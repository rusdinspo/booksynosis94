Priced to sell.</p><p>Verdi is a proud python, flourishing in the flower of his youth. He loves to swiftly slither around the forest, brandishing his bright yellow skin, and can't fathom why anyone would want to be sleepy and green like the adult snakes he knows. Verdi insists, as so many youngsters do, "I will never be lazy, boring or green!" Despite his resolve to stay young, one day he notices a patch of green spreading down the length of his body. Verdi does everything he can think of to erase this first sign of the inevitable tide of age. But in his frenzy of youthful, Icarus-like bravado, he nearly kills himself. Finally, Verdi learns that even though he can't stop the aging process, green skin won't keep him from being a fun-loving, young-at-heart, figure-eight-forming snake. <p>Janell Cannon's illustrations are exquisite. As in her award-winning <i>Stellaluna</i>, not only are the animal drawings painstakingly accurate, they are also awash with movement and beauty.

With her family, she pioneered throughout America&#x2019;s heartland during the 1870s and 1880s, finally settling in Dakota Territory. She married Almanzo Wilder in 1885; their only daughter, Rose, was born the following year. The Wilders moved to Rocky Ridge Farm at Mansfield, Missouri, in 1894, where they established a permanent home. After years of farming, Laura wrote the first of her beloved Little House books in 1932. The nine Little House books are international classics.

How do our brains make us the individuals that we are? In these 24 lectures, you&#39;ll investigate how the human brain is sculpted by evolution, constrained or freed by genes, shaped by early experience, modulated by hormones, and otherwise influenced to produce a wide range of behaviors - some of them abnormal. And you&#39;ll see that little can be explained by thinking about any one of these factors alone because some combination of influences is almost always at work. As you work through this thought-provoking and engaging material, you&#39;ll learn much about your own behavior, not to mention that of others. You&#39;ll discover how the brain and behavior are regulated; what genes at the molecular level have to do with brain function and how those genes have evolved; how neurobiology, neuroendocrinology, evolution, genetics, and ethology help explain an actual set of behaviors, with a particular focus on aggression; the role of the frontal cortex in decision-making, gratification postponement, and other important functions; and more. How much do these insights threaten our own sense of self and individuality? It&#39;s a provocative question, and it&#39;s one you&#39;ll find some answers to in Professor Sapolsky&#39;s masterful lectures on our neurological origins.</p><p></p><h2>Rommel and the Rebel</h2><p>Draws on an actual event--five German officers&#39; visit to the U.S. in the late 1930s--to create an engaging journey into historical legend, in which &#34;the Desert Fox&#34; travels incognito to the U.S. to study Civil War battle tactics</p><p>Lawrence Wells received B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of Alabama; and a Ph.D. from the University of Mississippi. He is also the author of &#34;Let the Band Play Dixie&#34; (Doubleday, 1987)In 1937, a group of German officers toured Civil War battlefields. What if one of them was Erwin Rommel? And what if he was obsessed with rebel Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, unorthodox but successful cavalry leader? German-speaking U.S. Army Intelligence Lt. Max Speigner is sent to Oxford, Miss., as liaison. He becomes friendly with Rommel because of their mutual regard for Forrest. When the British later find his memo on Rommel's tactics (borne out in the blitzkrieg), they call Max to Cairo in late 1941 to help in "divining" Rommel's plans. The former friends eventually meet again, struggling as enemies. Part of the book is silly (Rommel in New York at a ballgame), part is very unlikely (Rommel on a drunken, midnight tour of Shiloh with "Bill Faulkner") and part is overblown (fanciful flashbacks to Forrest's behavior in battle). But there's real excitement, especially in the scenes of Rommel's drive on Benghazi and a good depiction of the "Desert Fox" as the "respectable" German warrior.

It&#x2019;s an inquiry into why we swim&#x2014;the lure, the hold, the timeless magic of being in the water. It&#x2019;s a look at how swimming has changed over the millennia, how this ancient activity is becoming more social than solitary today. It&#x2019;s about our relationship with the water, with our fishy forebearers, and with the costumes that we wear. You&#x2019;ll even find a few songs to sing when you push out those next laps.<p>Swimming enthusiast Lynn Sherr explores every aspect of the sport, from the biology of swimming to the fame of Esther Williams; from turquoise pools and wild water to the training of Olympians; and she reveals the secret of buoyancy so that anyone can avoid the example of the English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, who lamented, &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t I swim, it seems so very easy?&#x201d; When his friend, the biographer Edward John Trelawny, said, &#x201c;because you think you can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Shelley plunged into Italy&#x2019;s Arno River and dropped like a rock. With <i>Swim</i>, you can avoid that happening to you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Broadcast journalist and writer Lynn Sherr was an award-winning correspondent for more than thirty years at ABC News.

In barely 200 pages of buoyant prose illustrated with photos, diagrams and swimming art, Sherr presents an enormous amount of aquatic info from the origins of strokes and the evolution of swimwear to the physiology of Olympic swimmers; from the skinny-dipping habits of John Quincy Adams to whether giraffes can swim. (Yes, just not well.) Best of all, Sherr captures the physical thrill of the one human activity that takes place in a completely alien element.

Ms. Sherr writes personably and moves her reader through her narrative at a pleasing pace What Ms. Sherr does best is describe the pleasures of the water, of finding yourself while losing yourself, giving yourself up to the supporting medium. and every chapter of the book builds her personal narrative while placing it in the context of often fascinating mini-treatises on subjects that reach beyond the water. She writes interestingly about women and bathing suits (Diana Vreeland pronounced the bikini "the most important thing since the atom bomb") and about the effects of water on women's hair, topics that become, with her attention, more than merely peripheral.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><br> In <i>Swim</i>, a joyful plunge into the history, lore and legend of swimming, US journalist and avid swimmer Lynn Sherr explores the pleasures of gliding through cool waters while preparing to follow Leander and Byron and cross the Hellespont herself.&#x201d;<p></p><br><b><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b><br><i>"</i>A thorough celebration of swimming, and what it has taught us over the centuries.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br><br><b><i>Washington Post</i></b><br> This book will enchant anyone who's drawn to water, whether you swim once a week at the local pool or dedicate your life to briny challenges . Beautifully illustrated with maps, texts and rare images of swimming from Egyptian hieroglyphs through Hollywood to the Olympic Games. [Sherr] delivers it all in beautiful prose: She is an award-winning writer and broadcast journalist, a well-known face on ABC News for 30 years. This is Sherr in her element, eagerly sharing her life's passion through an assiduous look at swimming and what it means. Perhaps the tiny swimmer breaststroking over and over again at the foot of each page is Sherr herself . SWIM is the only book I've ever read that gathers together everything we love about swimming in one volume. It's all here.

Lewis became the first writer from the United States to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature and his were noted for their critical views of American capitalism and materialism. With classics such as Main Street, Babbitt, and Arrowsmith, Lewis remains one of the most widely read authors in the world. Main Street, published in 1920, is a novel that is set in Minnesota and centers around Carol Milford, a liberal young woman who marries a doctor named Will Kenicott. When the couple moves to Will&#39;s hometown Carol is shocked at what she finds.</p><p>This classic by Sinclair Lewis shattered the sentimental American myth of happy small-town life with its satire. &#34;Main Street attacks the conformity and dullness of early 20th Century midwestern village life in the story of Carol Milford, the city girl who marries the town doctor. Her efforts to bring culture to the prairie village are met by a wall of gossip, greed, and petty small-minded bigotry. Lewis&#39;s complex and compelling work established him as an important character in American literature.<p>Nobel Prize-winning writer Sinclair Lewis (1885-1951) is best known for novels like Main Street, Babbitt, Arrowsmith (for which he was awarded but declined the Pulitzer Prize), and Elmer Gantry. A writer from his youth, Lewis wrote for and edited the Yale Literary Magazine while a student, and started his literary career writing popular stories for magazines and selling plots to other writers like Jack London. Lewis s talent for description and creating unique characters won him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1930, making him the first American writer to win the prestigious award. Considered to be one of the greats of American literature, Lewis was honoured with a Great Americans series postage stamp, and his work has been adapted for both stage and screen.</p></p><h2>The National Archaeological Museum of Naples</h2><p>collectable</p><p></p><h2>Richard Scarry's Mixed-Up Cars &amp; Trucks</h2><p>Turn the pages, mix&nbsp; 'em up, and have fun!

While FDR&#x2019;s official circle was predominantly male, it was his relationships with women&#x2013;particularly with Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd&#x2013;that most vividly bring to light the human being beneath this towering statesman. It is no coincidence that Rutherfurd was with Roosevelt the day he died in Warm Springs, Georgia, along with two other close women companions. In <i>Franklin and Lucy</i>, acclaimed author and historian Joseph E. Persico explores FDR&#x2019;s romance with Lucy Rutherfurd, which was far deeper and lasted much longer than was previously acknowledged. Persico&#x2019;s provocative conclusions about their relationship are informed by a revealing range of sources, including never-before-published letters and documents from Lucy Rutherfurd&#x2019;s estate that attest to the intensity and scope of the affair.<br><br>FDR&#x2019;s connection with Lucy also creates an opportunity for Persico to take a more penetrating look at the other women in FDR&#x2019;s life. We come to see more clearly how FDR&#x2019;s infidelity as a husband contributed to Eleanor&#x2019;s eventual transformation from a repressed Victorian to perhaps the greatest American woman of her century; how the shaping hand of FDR&#x2019;s strong-willed mother helped to imbue him with the resolve to overcome personal and public adversity throughout his life; and how other women around FDR, including his &#x201c;surrogate spouse,&#x201d; Missy LeHand, and his close confidante, the obscure Margaret &#x201c;Daisy&#x201d; Suckley, completed the world that he inhabited. <br><br><i>Franklin and Lucy </i>is an extraordinary look at the private life of a leader who continues to fascinate scholars and the general public alike. In focusing on Lucy Rutherfurd and the myriad women who mattered to Roosevelt, Persico paints a more intimate portrait than we have heretofore had of this enigmatic giant of American history.</p><p>Joseph E. Persico is the author of <i>Roosevelt&#x2019;s Secret War: FDR and World War II Espionage; Eleventh Month, Eleventh Day, Eleventh Hour: Armistice Day, 1918&#x2013;World War I</i> <i>and Its Violent Climax; Piercing the Reich</i>; and <i>Nuremberg: Infamy on Trial</i>, which was made into a television docudrama. He also collaborated with Colin Powell on his autobiography, <i>My American Journey</i>. He lives in Guilderland, New York.Chapter 1 <br>SCARLET LETTERS <br>He belonged in uniform. His country was at war. He was thirty-six years old and bursting with vitality. Before going to work in the morning at the Navy Department he often played a round of golf. On weekends, he rarely got in less than thirty-six holes. During the week he worked out with Walter Camp, the football coach and fitness enthusiast. Lathrop Brown, his Harvard roommate, was serving in the new tank corps. Harry Hooker, his former law partner, was now Major Hooker, on the staff of the 53rd Division American Expeditionary Forces. Another law partner and Harvard pal, Langdon Marvin, was driving an ambulance in France with the Red Cross. His four distant cousins, Archibald, Kermit, Theodore Jr., and Quentin, sons of Franklin&#x2019;s idol, former President Theodore Roosevelt, had all enlisted. The exploits of TR&#x2019;s boys filled the newspapers, arousing in Franklin competing emotions of pride and envy. Even his nearsighted brother-in-law, Hall Roosevelt, had volunteered. <br><br>On the very day that war had been declared, April 6, 1917, the Roosevelt clan gathered at the home of TR&#x2019;s married daughter, Alice Roosevelt Longworth. There the former commander-in-chief seized Franklin by the shoulders, fixed him with his myopic gaze, and pleaded with him to resign as assistant secretary of the navy. &#x201c;You must get into uniform at once,&#x201d; TR urged. &#x201c;You must get in.&#x201d; <br><br>Franklin was all too willing. Patriotism was the main reason, but politics intruded as well. In 1898, when America had gone to war against Spain over Cuba, TR had resigned from the very Navy post Franklin now held. He had formed his own regiment, the Rough Riders. He had worn the uniform, known war, and subsequently reached the political pinnacle. TR&#x2019;s trajectory was not lost on his ambitious young relative. Franklin&#x2019;s chief, Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, easily detected the parallels. &#x201c;Theodore left the position of assistant secretary to become a Rough Rider, later Governor of New York and then President, and both had served in the legislature of New York,&#x201d; Daniels noted. &#x201c;Franklin actually thought fighting in the War was the necessary step toward reaching the White House.&#x201d; Franklin&#x2019;s mother, Sara, had recently written her son, &#x201c;The papers say buttons and pictures of you are being prepared to run for Governor.&#x201d; But Franklin preferred to take TR&#x2019;s route, military service first. <br><br>Theodore Roosevelt, now fifty-nine, blind in one eye, partially deaf, his body racked by punishing expeditions into the disease-infested Brazilian jungle, was itching to answer his country&#x2019;s call again. He hoped to raise a volunteer division just as he had raised a regiment in the earlier war. He pleaded with Franklin to get him an appointment with President Woodrow Wilson. This request could prove ticklish. Ever since TR, as a third-party candidate, had been beaten by Wilson five years before in the 1912 presidential election, he had been lambasting the winner for everything from woolly-headedness to cowardice for not getting America into the European war sooner. Nevertheless, the day after the Roosevelt gathering at cousin Alice&#x2019;s house, Franklin did go to the secretary of war, Newton Baker, and persuade him to intervene with Wilson on TR&#x2019;s behalf. The president would later say of meeting with his old foe, &#x201c;I was charmed by his personality . . . you can&#x2019;t resist the man.&#x201d; Evidently he was able to resist, since he told Baker afterward, &#x201c;I really think the best way to treat Mr. Roosevelt is to take no notice of him.&#x201d; TR was baffled by Wilson&#x2019;s failure to seize upon his heartfelt offer. As he left the White House with Wilson&#x2019;s confidant, Colonel Edward M. House, he complained, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand. After all, I&#x2019;m only asking to be allowed to die,&#x201d; to which House reportedly responded, &#x201c;Oh, did you make that point quite clear to the President?&#x201d;<br><br>Uncle Ted had not made it back into uniform himself, but his admonition still echoed in Franklin&#x2019;s ear: &#x201c;I should be ashamed of my sons if they shirked war.&#x201d; After TR&#x2019;s White House visit, Franklin did submit his resignation as assistant secretary in order to enlist. But when the letter landed on Wilson&#x2019;s desk, the president rejected what he considered military romanticism. He told Secretary Daniels to inform his subordinate that he was no different from any draftee. &#x201c;Neither you nor I nor Franklin Roosevelt has the right to select the place of service,&#x201d; he warned. &#x201c;Tell the young man . . . to stay where he is.&#x201d; Unfazed, Roosevelt next went to Wilson personally, only to be turned down again. The rejection, nevertheless, did illuminate Roosevelt&#x2019;s rising star. Wilson&#x2019;s former Army chief of staff, General Leonard Wood, observed that &#x201c;Franklin Roosevelt should under no circumstances think of leaving the Navy Department; that would amount to a public calamity.&#x201d; The real power in the U.S. Navy, Wood believed, was not Secretary Daniels, but his aggressive deputy. <br><br>As the country entered its fifteenth month of the war a still frustrated Franklin managed to wangle an assignment that lifted him, if not exactly to combatant status, at least to something more than a deskbound civilian. He urged Secretary Daniels to allow him to go to Europe &#x201c;to look into our Naval administration in order to work more closely with the other services.&#x201d; The essentially pacifist Daniels felt no necessity himself to witness the bloodletting firsthand and eventually yielded to Franklin&#x2019;s ceaseless importuning, even allowing his assistant to write his own orders, essentially a blank check to pursue &#x201c;such other purposes as may be deemed expedient upon your arrival.&#x201d; Franklin confided to his wife that he had been promised a commission as a Navy lieutenant commander upon his return. Before leaving, he sent President Wilson a letter saying he hoped the speculation about his running for governor of New York would end. He was not going to &#x201c;give up war work for what is frankly very much a local political job in these times.&#x201d; <br><br>That summer of 1918, as the day of his departure approached, his behavior began taking on an air of mystery. He told Eleanor only that he must leave her alone with their five children, but could not disclose where he was going or for how long. She was not to see him off, since the mission was secret. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell a soul,&#x201d; he warned her, &#x201c;not even Mama.&#x201d; Franklin had one more goodbye to make before he left, one unknown to Eleanor, and one that moved him to mixed longing and pride. Meeting secretly, he and a beautiful woman made impassioned promises of letters to be exchanged, how this was to be safely carried out during his absence, and what needed to be resolved on his return, for Franklin Roosevelt was in love. <br><br>He sailed for Europe from the Washington Navy Yard on July 9, 1918, aboard the destroyer USS Dyer, rushed into service just eight days before and heading into the war zone without benefit of sea trials. Despite his position, he told his wife that he had requested no ceremonies. Once aboard ship, Franklin started a diary, the basis for a book he intended to write, an intention that showed through in the grandiloquence of his first entry: &#x201c;The good old ocean is so absolutely normal just as it always has been, sometimes tumbling about and throwing spray, sometimes gently lolling about . . . but now though the ocean looks much unchanged the doubled number of lookouts shows that even here the hand of the Hun False God is reaching out to defy nature; ten miles ahead of this floating City of Souls a torpedo maybe waiting to start on its quick run.&#x201d; <br><br>The Dyer joined a troop convoy delivering another twenty thousand doughboys to the over one million already in France: &#x201c;a wonderful sight,&#x201d; Franklin noted in the diary, &#x201c;five monsters in the half light . . . it thrills to think that right there another division is on the way to the front.&#x201d; Every element of danger quickened his sense that at last he was in the war, as when the Dyer zigzagged to thwart marauding U-boats, &#x201c;9 different course changes,&#x201d; in an hour; and when he learned that &#x201c;only 15 or 16 of the crew&#x201d; had ever been in the war zone; and when he was assigned his abandon ship station, whale boat number 2, should the worst happen. <br><br>He was gone just over ten weeks. Looking back, he counted the mission a brilliant success. He had met personally with all the Allied leaders, the fiery British prime minister, David Lloyd George, whom Franklin was delighted to find &#x201c;is just like his pictures.&#x201d; Even more impressive to Roosevelt, with his weakness for royalty, was a private audience at Buckingham Palace with King George V. Franklin recorded in his diary that the king had given him forty minutes alone and seemed genuinely impressed that his American visitor had crossed the Atlantic on a warship. &#x201c;His one regret,&#x201d; the king told him, &#x201c;was that it had been impossible for him to do active Naval service during the war,&#x201d; reflecting Franklin&#x2019;s own disappointment. The king then confided that though he had blood relatives in Germany, particularly Kaiser Wilhelm, &#x201c;in all my life I have never seen a German gentleman.&#x201d; <br><br>Franklin had next gone on to France, where he was again welcomed at the summit, meeting French president Raymond Poincair� and premier Georges Clemenceau. &#x201c;I was in the presence of the greatest civilian in France,&#x201d; he wrote in his diary of Clemenceau. &#x201c;He almost ran forward to meet me and shook hands as if he meant it.&#x201d; The sixty-six-year-old premier, known as &#x201c;The Tiger,&#x201d; related to Roosevelt a thrilling account of his recent visit to the front where a French and German soldier were found &#x201c;trying to bite each other to death when a shell had killed them both,&amp;...</p><h2>The House with Sixteen Handmade Doors: A Tale of Architectural Choice and Craftsmanship</h2><p><p><strong>An architectural whodunit that unlocks the secrets of a hand-built home.</strong></p> When Henry Petroski and his wife Catherine bought a charming but modest six-decades-old island retreat in coastal Maine, Petroski couldn&#x2019;t help but admire its unusual construction. An eminent expert on engineering, history, and design, he began wondering about the place&#x2019;s origins and evolution: Who built it, and how? What needs, materials, technologies, historical developments, and laws shaped it? How had it fared through the years with its various inhabitants? <p>Sleuthing around dimly lit closets, knotty-pine wall panels, and even a secret passage&#x2015;but never removing so much as a nail&#x2015;Petroski zooms in on the details but also steps back to examine the structure in the context of its time and place.</p><p>Catherine Petroski&#x2019;s beautiful photographs capture the clues and the atmosphere.

In his latest work, Petroski picks a much more personal topic on which to focus his manufacturing expertise, his own second home on a riverbank in coastal Maine. When Petroski and his wife, Catherine, bought the cabin-like retreat several years ago, he had little idea it would be filled with enough design quirks to provoke him into a full-scale investigation of its construction history. Along with knotty pine walls and oddly built closets, the house features its own secret passage. Petroski&#x2019;s research included surveying the building&#x2019;s unusual environs and interviewing former owners and surviving relatives of its eccentric builder. Though this fascinating history of a house includes painstaking attention to woodcrafting techniques that may excite professional and amateur �architects and �carpenters a bit more than general readers, the book is replete with Petroski&#x2019;s usual fascinating details and elegant prose. --Carl Hays</p><h2>Herman&#39;s Letter</h2><p><p>Herman the bear and Henry the raccoon are best friends.

Yet within a decade and a half he had brought it to the point where it was the strongest in Europe. His successes on the battle field led to his methods being painstakingly analyzed by commentators and slavishly imitated by Western armies.<br><br>His success was not only due to far sighted strategic planning, the comprehensive reorganization of the General Staff and his grasp of new technologies; it was also due to his leadership of a talented, if disparate, group of subordinates, even if some of them sometimes failed to grasp his overall intentions.<br><br>This book examines these key relationships. Foremost among these was his collaboration with the able though choleric Karl Leonhard von Blumenthal; their correspondence reflected every aspect of their campaigns. He was also close to the Crown Prince, whose aide de camp he had been. Moltke was Chief of Staff to Prince Frederick Charles in Denmark in 1864; his admiration for the &#x2018;Red Prince&#x2019; was perhaps not maintained when the latter&#x2019;s caution caused problems. Albrecht von Stosch, Intendant General in 1870&#x2013;1871, proved brilliantly successful when he had the chance to demonstrate his talents in the field. Edwin von Manteuffel, on whose recommendation Moltke was appointed, was at the centre of Prussian politics for a decade and a half before becoming a successful army commander in 1866, and 1870&#x2013;1871. Perhaps the most talented of Moltke's subordinates was August von Goeben, a successful commander in all three wars of German unification. August von Werder never enjoyed Moltke's confidence to the same extent, but was extremely reliable. On the other hand both Eduard Vogel von Falckenstein and Karl von Steinmetz caused Moltke considerable difficulty by their stubborn disobedience of his explicit orders.<br><br>Behind these relationships there existed the vital rapport which Moltke had with their Chiefs of Staff and his own general staff officers. It was on his ability to rely on these men to execute his intentions that his success ultimately depended. Theophil von Podbielski, Julius Verdy du Vernois and Paul Bronsart von Schellendorf were some of the brilliant individuals who constituted one of the most powerful teams in military history.</p><p>Quintin Barry is a solicitor and retired Employment Judge.

This work is an excellent analysis of the personality and impact that Moltke&#x2019;s initiatives brought to the German General staff. Beyond that, it discusses at length the methodologies needed to build and lead the command environment created by this decentralized style. Moltke&#x2019;s confidence in his subordinates and his innate ability to understand when to not intervene are traits modern commanders should be striving to emulate.

The daughter of Lord Louis Mountbatten and his glamorous wife Edwina Ashley, she was brought up by nannies and governesses as she was often parted from her parents as they dutifully carried out their public roles. A solitary child, she learned to occupy her days lost in a book, riding or playing with the family's animals (which included at different times a honey bear, chameleons, a bush baby, two wallabies, a lion, a mongoose and a coati mundi). Her parents' vast social circle included royalty, film stars, senior service officers, politicians and celebrities. Noel Coward invited Pamela to watch him filming; Douglas Fairbanks Jr. dropped in for tea and Churchill would call for 'a word with Dickie'.<br><br>After the war, Pamela truly came of age in India, while her parents were the Last Viceroy and Vicereine. This introduction to the country would start a life-long love affair with the people and the place.</p><p>The daughter of Lord Louis and Edwina Mountbatten, Lady Pamela Hicks was Lady in Waiting to the Queen both when she was a princess and following her coronation. In the 1960s she married the flamboyant designer David Hicks who became internationally celebrated. This is Lady Pamela Hicks&#39; second book, her first, India Remembered - an illustrated account of the Mountbattens during the Transfer of Power was published in 2007.Daughter of Empire 1 <p></p> <br>My father could trace his roots back to the ninth century. Through forty-one generations, he was able to recount the lives of our ancestors&#x2014;royalists, rebels, and saints. He never tired of telling me that it was extremely rare for a family to be able to cite two canonized antecedents. &#x201c;The first,&#x201d; he would say proudly, &#x201c;goes way back to the thirteenth century. St. Elisabeth of Hungary was a gracious princess who secretly gave alms to the poor. Her husband didn&#x2019;t approve of this and, one morning, ordered her to remove the cover of her basket. And&#x201d;&#x2014;I loved the ending of this story&#x2014;&#x201c;her forbidden bread had miraculously turned into roses.<br> <br>&#x201c;The other was your great-aunt Ella, Grand Duchess Serge of Russia, who, following her husband&#x2019;s assassination, became a nun and worked tirelessly among the poor and sick of Moscow. In 1918, when she, the chief nun, three young princes, a grand duke, and a lady-in-waiting were thrown down a mine shaft by the Bolsheviks&#x2014;along with a few hand grenades for good measure&#x2014;witnesses heard her clear sweet voice singing &#x2018;Hail Gentle Light&#x2019; and other hymns of fortitude to her fellow victims. Before she died, she tore up her nun&#x2019;s veil to provide bandages for the princes&#x2019; wounds.&#x201d;<br> <br>Now known as St. Elisabeth of Romanova, my great-aunt is one of twelve modern saints preserved in sculpture above the West Door of Westminster Abbey. It was hard to keep track of my father&#x2019;s long line of relatives, but as he loved lists and charts and stories, he was always ready to bring them to life. For many generations his ancestors had been rulers of the Grand Duchy of Hesse in Germany, a landlocked territory far from the coast. It was his father, Prince Louis Alexander of Battenberg, who changed all that and altered the course of the family&#x2019;s path. In 1868, at the tender age of fourteen, beset by dreams of a seafaring life, he surprised everyone by announcing that he was leaving home to set sail. In fact he was so determined to become part of the &#x201c;greatest navy in the world&#x201d; that he took British citizenship, eventually rising to the top job of First Sea Lord and Admiral of the Fleet. He didn&#x2019;t cut off his ties with Europe completely, though, falling in love with his cousin Princess Victoria of Hesse, a sparky, independent-minded granddaughter of Queen Victoria, who was related to most of the royal courts in Europe. In those days it wasn&#x2019;t always an advantage to have family members scattered across Europe, and during the First World War his mother found herself on opposite sides to her brother and sister. Luckily, my father always said, while patriotism was intense, it never undermined strong family affections.<br> <br>My grandparents married in 1884 and lived variously in England, Germany, and Malta. My father, also Prince Louis of Battenberg but known as &#x201c;Dickie,&#x201d; was born in 1900, the youngest of four children. The aging Queen Victoria held him at his christening and he wriggled so much that he got her full square in the face with a fist and a foot, knocking off her spectacles. He always told me that at only a few weeks old, he couldn&#x2019;t possibly have known he was to be &#x201c;seen and not heard&#x201d; while in the queen&#x2019;s arms.<br> <br>My father was blessed with enlightened parents. His mother in particular thought that children should not only be seen and very much heard but that they should also be exposed to new ideas and the classics. She kept meticulous records of the books she read and was always keen to try new experiences. Passionate about cartography, she worked for many years on a detailed geological map of Malta, participated in archaeological digs, and rather daringly, scooping up my father to provide the required extra weight, flew in a zeppelin airship and a very early model of a biplane, even though, as she said, &#x201c;it was not made to carry passengers and we perched securely on a little stool holding on to the flier&#x2019;s back.&#x201d; Coming from a line of progressive thinkers, she taught my father herself until he was ten years old, gifting him an education that was thorough and polymathic. She taught him to be open-minded, methodical, and thorough, and above all encouraged him to enjoy learning, to inquire. Later, when I got to know my grandmother, I could see how entirely free of prejudice she was, how interested she was in all that was around her, and just how much of an influence she had had on my father&#x2019;s refreshing way of viewing the world. She was to be an inspiring force in my life.<br> <br>A month before his tenth birthday my father was sent to Lockers Park prep school in Hertfordshire, and two years later he entered the Royal Naval College at Osborne. As war became inevitable, at the beginning of 1914, his German-born father was forced to retire from the Admiralty as first sea lord because of the anti-German hysteria at large in the country, scurrilous newspaper headlines whipping people up into a frenzy of hatred. My grandfather resigned, even though the navy was solidly behind him, and this episode had a profound effect on my father, who vowed to succeed to the position of his wronged father. Then, during the war, when King George V decreed that the royal family should anglicize their name, choosing Windsor, my grandfather changed his from Battenberg to Mountbatten. The king created him the Marquess of Milford Haven, having offered him the title of duke, but, practical to the last and looking around him at the grandeur of the English nobility, he calculated that as his savings had been decimated in the German economic downturn, he simply didn&#x2019;t have the wealth that would be expected of him with that rank: an English duke had to maintain a grand style of life. My father also ceased to be the younger Prince Louis of Battenberg and received the courtesy title of Lord Louis Mountbatten.<br> <br>During the First World War, my father joined Lord Beatty&#x2019;s flagship HMS Lion as a midshipman, and later he was appointed first lieutenant of a small ship, HMS P31, and for a time, aged only eighteen, he found himself in command of a crew of sixty. Through Princess Mary my father contrived that King George V should come on board during the Peace Pageant on the Thames. He saluted smartly as the monarch came aboard. &#x201c;Hello, Dickie,&#x201d; said the king jovially, &#x201c;how&#x2019;s Chicken Bella?&#x201d; The fact that his sovereign remembered the stupid doll he had had as a two-year-old mortified the nineteen-year-old second in command and exposed him to remorseless teasing.<br> <br>The Admiralty now sent the &#x201c;war babies&#x201d; who had been unable to complete their education to Cambridge University, and my father went with both Prince Albert and Prince Henry. They all led a wildly social life, falling in and out of love between studying. Tall, with the good looks of a Hollywood film star, my father was very much in demand. He was also in demand from the royal household, accompanying the Prince of Wales&#x2014;the future King Edward VIII&#x2014;as his personal aide-de-camp, on tours including Australia and, later, India and Japan.<br> <br>Grace Kelly once confided that she had always kept a photograph of my father before she met Prince Rainier. Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt, a fiercely rich American society hostess, nicknamed &#x201c;the Kingfisher&#x201d; for her relentless cultivation of European royalty, singled my father out as the perfect suitor for her only daughter. When she invited him to a tea party on her yacht off Cowes, my father was immediately smitten, falling helplessly in love at first sight. Only it wasn&#x2019;t quite as Mrs. Vanderbilt had intended, for on board that afternoon was a gathering of young ladies, including Edwina Ashley, an effortlessly glamorous heiress, who had recently learned to stand with her hips pushed slightly forward, the very image of beau monde chic. With one hand on her slender hip, the charms of her gold bracelet glinting off the other in the sun, my father was at once dazzled and delighted. Although they had met a couple of times previously, they began to court in earnest, and when my father went to India with the prince, Edwina followed him, staying at the Viceregal Lodge. It became obvious to all that they were very much in love, so much so that the Prince of Wales lent them his sitting room so that my father could propose.<br> <br>On 18 July 1922, they were married in St. Margaret&#x2019;s, Westminster, tucked in the shadow of Westminster Abbey on Parliament Square. It was the most talked-about society wedding of the year, and when my mother walked out on the arm of her dashing husband, beneath a naval arch of swords, they were congratulated by a host of royals, including King George V, Queen Mary, and the Queen Mother, Alexandra. At the sumptuous reception, the Prince of Wales gave the best man&#x2019;s speech, following which my parents enjoyed a rather protracted honeymoon, traveling to France, Spain, Germany, and the States, where they stayed with Hollywood&#x2019;s royalty, the king and queen of silent movies, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. They even made a short silent home movie with Charlie Chaplin entitled Nice and Easy, in which Charlie played a rogue trying to steal the pearls of the heroine (my mother), who is rescued by her lover (my father). My mother&#x2019;s performance showed suitable girlish alarm, my father&#x2019;s acting was dreadful, and of course Charlie stole the show. Happily exhausted, they returned to Manhattan for the last days of their adventure, where they stayed as guests of the very game Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt, who bore no grudges.<br> <br>Marriage, my father&#x2019;s love, and a sense of her own destiny&#x2014;this is just what my mother needed. Since her &#x201c;coming out&#x201d; she had been living with her grandfather, Sir Ernest Cassell, in his London home, Brook House, stoically hosting his large parties of elderly grandees and financiers, but his death in the year before her marriage had left my mother feeling empty, memories of her lonely childhood flooding back to her. Raised by a series of nannies and housekeepers in Broadlands, a large Palladian mansion near Romsey in Hampshire, Edwina and her younger sister, Mary, were mostly kept apart from their parents. Her mother, Maudie, suffered from consumption and, as her condition deteriorated, she spent more and more time away, particularly in Egypt. Their father, Wilfred, a Conservative MP, was rarely at home either, busy attending to his political duties. My mother&#x2019;s early letters show how anxious she was to see her &#x201c;darling mother&#x201d; again. Having been misled by a well-intentioned suggestion from their governess, my mother believed that the reason for their separation was that she was going to be a sister again, and she wrote to her mother at least twice expressing her and Mary&#x2019;s desire to have a little brother. After a while the penny dropped and she tried to keep the desperation out of her letters, going out of her way to keep her tone upbeat. When Maudie finally returned to Broadlands, it was thought too upsetting for the children to witness their mother&#x2019;s failing health, so they were sent away to a cousin. And even though my mother wrote several times with growing urgency and despair, pleading to see her mother again, she was never allowed to, and Maudie died in February 1911. My mother and Mary did not attend the funeral.<br> <br>My mother was brave, hiding her emotions well, containing her sister, who became very difficult, throwing tantrums and creating scenes. It seemed that she was the only one who could calm Mary down, and forever after, she felt responsible for her younger sister&#x2019;s safety and well-being. A subdued period of existence followed, during which time the girls learned to pour their bruised feelings into caring for a menagerie of domestic pets&#x2014;puppies, ponies, rabbits, kittens, and a goat. For a brief while, their lives were cheered and enriched by the arrival of Laura Deveira, a loving young governess to whom the sisters became deeply attached, but just as they began to settle down and come out of their protective shells, their father presented them with a new stepmother and the world came crashing down again.<br> <br>Molly Forbes-Sempill replaced their beloved Miss Deveira with a governess of her choice and sent the girls to bed every evening by half past six so they were &#x201c;out of the way,&#x201d; a phrase that deeply upset my mother. My mother and aunt were forbidden to pick a single flower from the garden from the moment she moved in, and Broadlands became a sterile and difficult place in which to live. Eventually my mother went to school near Eastbourne&#x2014;another lonely place for her&#x2014;where the pupils took it in turns &#x201c;hooking up Miss Potts,&#x201d; a humiliating task involving wrestling with endless hooks and buttons in order to help the headmistress secure her dress each morning. Things improved little more when, aged eighteen, my mother was sent to a domestic science training college. It was while here that she vowed never to go back and live at Broadlands while her stepmother was alive. On leaving she went to live in London with her grandfather, Sir Ernest.<br> <br>Life changed for the better when she met my father. They had both been recently touched by death&#x2014;my father distraught at the loss of his father, my mother by the unexpected death of her grandfather&#x2014;and initially they sought solace in each other. As time passed, however, and finally freed from her past, rich from her inheritance (which included Brook House), and happily in love, my mother found life opening up for her. This was the beginning of the &#x201c;roaring twenties,&#x201d; a time of exuberance and great optimism: jazz, dance, and liberating new styles. My mother was fashionably slender&#x2014;she referred to herself as a &#x201c;straight actress&#x201d; with vital statistics of twenty-six all the way down&#x2014;and she took full advantage of the freedom afforded to women now that bustles and corsets were obstructions of the past. She soon cut her hair short � la mode and kept it immaculately coiffed. As hemlines rose and shoes became more prominent, my mother had hers handmade in Paris, a pair in every color. This was the extravagant time in my parents&#x2019; lives&#x2014;they had a cinema screen installed in Brook House and hosted regular parties at which princes, even kings and queens, could rub shoulders with the likes of No�l Coward, Cole Porter, and George Gershwin. By playing it at her parties, my mother made &#x201c;The Man I Love&#x201d; an overnight hit in England after Gershwin told her how upset he was that it had flopped in the United States. She danced the Charleston with Fred Astaire, and the rumors that Queen Mary didn&#x2019;t approve of this kind of behavior made the dancing all the more delicious.<br> <br>If they weren&#x2019;t entertaining at home, my parents went out to clubs, and it was only when they arrived that the party really got started. Once they had danced into the early hours, they would return to Brook House, music ringing in their ears, and collapse into bed. As was the fashion in those days, they kept separate bedrooms&#x2014;my father&#x2019;s decorated to look like a ship&#x2019;s cabin, a porthole in the wall with an ingenious &#x201c;view&#x201d; of Malta built behind. He had designed the light switch himself so that when turned down it emitted a low hum, like that of a ship&#x2019;s engine, and this helped him get to sleep. The walls were pale green and the carpet black, the bed was covered in a thick orange cotton quilt handwoven in Malta&#x2014;this much I know because it would be the same wherever we lived thereafter. My mother slept next door between pink satin sheets with a swan&#x2019;s-down quilt covered in pink ostrich feathers so that it appeared to float.<br> <br>During the first months of their marriage, while my father was waiting for the completion of the ship to which he had been assigned, he and my mother continued to enjo...</p><h2>Cure Back Pain: 80 Personalized Easy Exercises for Spinal Training to Improve Posture, Eliminate Tension and Reduce Stress</h2><p><p> Using the latest advances in the science of movement, this book offers the unique and innovative Spinal Training method to help prevent and alleviate back pain.

But we no longer hear Robinson speak for himself; his death at age fifty-three in 1972 robbed America of his voice far too soon.<br>In <i>First Class Citizenship</i>, Jackie Robinson comes alive on the page for the first time in decades. The scholar Michael G. Long has unearthed a remarkable trove of Robinson's correspondence with--and personal replies from--such towering figures as Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Hubert Humphrey, Nelson Rockefeller, and Barry Goldwater. These extraordinary conversations reveal the scope and depth of Robinson's effort during the 1950s and 1960s to rid America of racism. <br>Writing eloquently and with evident passion, Robinson charted his own course, offering his support to Democrats and to Republicans, questioning the tactics of the civil rights movement, and challenging the nation's leaders when he felt they were guilty of hypocrisy--or worse. Through his words as well as his actions, Jackie Robinson truly personified the "first class citizenship" that he considered the birthright of all Americans, whatever their race.</p><p>Michael G.

Two months later, on October 23, Branch Rickey, general manager of the Dodgers, offered Robinson a formal contract to play for the Montreal Royals, the Dodgers' top farm team. In this handwritten letter to Ralph Norton, an acquaintance from his days at Pasadena Junior College, Robinson writes of his tryout in Florida the following spring.</i>&nbsp;<br>March 12, 1946&nbsp;<br>Hello Ralph,&nbsp;<br>I too remember the good old days at P.J.C. and I remember you from the Chronicle. It was nice hearing from you and I do appreciate your well wishes. It would be really nice hearing from the fellows you mentioned, and I am sure that if we get encouraging letters such as yours it is going to be tough keeping us off the club. I would appreciate hearing more from you and I will keep you informed as to our progress. So far it has been a real pleasure playing here with the fellows. Everyone has been so nice and they have given us help along the way. I did not expect any trouble but I also did not expect to be welcomed as I have. It reminds me of the days at P.J.C. when all the fellows used to block and clear the way so I could run with the ball. We have met a couple that have resented us, but only a sharp eye could tell. All I can say is if we make the club, it will be on our own merit. If not it will be due to the fact that the many ballplayers Montreal has are better than we are. Our manager Clay Hopper has been very helpful and is giving us every chance possible. If you hear from Glick, Vanderweer or Shatford give them my regards.&nbsp;<br>Sincerely, Jackie&nbsp;<br><i>Robinson made his major-league debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 15, 1947, and among his ardent supporters that year was Bernice Franklin, the owner of a general store near Tyronza, Arkansas. "I live in a small all-Negro town," she wrote Robinson. "We go to Memphis for all our amusements, but there is no greater thrill than a broadcast of the Dodgers baseball game ... right now the farmers are gathering [at the store] for your game this afternoon." Another fan was Norman Thomas, leader of the Socialist Party of America, six-time candidate for the presidency, and advocate for racial justice and world peace. Throughout 1947 Robinson agreed to follow Rickey's biblical admonition to "turn the other cheek," and Thomas was pleased with this nonviolent strategy.</i>&nbsp;<br>September 23, 1947&nbsp;<br>Dear Mr. Robinson:&nbsp;<br>Now that the Dodgers have won the pennant, it is very appropriate, I think, to thank you not only for what you did in the pennant race but for what you have done for the colored race and for the fraternity which ought to characterize our mutual relations. You have performed a real service to our country and in general to a world which must learn to honor men for what they are and do regardless of race.I am writing on the letterhead of an organization interested in the kind of world relations that will bring peace, and I rather think its members would share my feeling about your contribution to the kind of attitude on which peace depends.&nbsp;<br>Sincerely yours, Norman ThomasROBINSON TO ADMIRER<i>Not all fan mail was as high-minded as Norman Thomas's, and the following is Robinson's reply to a troubled young woman who had written of her love for him. The letter reveals Robinson's quick and easy appeal to moral principles--an appeal that would become characteristic of his civil rights letters.</i>&nbsp;<br>October 15, 1947&nbsp;<br>Dear Miss [editor's deletion]:&nbsp;<br>Ordinarily I wouldn't even consider answering a letter like yours, but I believe you need to get straightened out on a few things. A girl as attractive and intelligent as you sound certainly should have no difficulty in finding the right man and creating a sound, honest life together in marriage. You are suffering from some kind of mental delusion that can bring you nothing but trouble and unhappiness and my advice is to get interested in some kind of work outside your daily routine in the office.When I married Mrs. Robinson, I exchanged vows to love, honor and cherish her for the rest of my life. "Honor" means just that to me, and any sneaking, skulking escapade would destroy the very thing that enables me to hold my head up high.Just in case you might want to write me again, I must inform you that all my mail is opened at the Brooklyn baseball club offices and then forwarded to me.&nbsp;<br>Yours in reproof, Jackie RobinsonLESTER GRANGER TO ROBINSON<i>By now a celebrity athlete, Robinson appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) on July 18, 1949, as it held hearings on African American loyalty to the United States. Of special concern to the committee was a remark reportedly made by Paul Robeson, the internationally renowned singer and actor, about the possibility of a war between the United States and the Soviet Union. "It is unthinkable," Robeson allegedly stated, "that American Negroes would go to war on behalf of those who have oppressed us for generations against a country which in one generation has raised our people to the full dignity of mankind." In his widely publicized testimony, Robinson characterized Robeson's remark as "very silly," adding that African Americans would "do their best to help their country stay out of war; if unsuccessful, they'd do their best to help their country win the war--against Russia or any other enemy that threatened us." Lester Granger, executive director of the National Urban League, praise Robinson in the following letter. Near the end of his life, however Robinson expressed regret for appearing before HUAC.</i>July 19, 1949&nbsp;<br>Dear Robbie:&nbsp;<br>Together with hundreds of thousands of other Americans in New York City and throughout the country, I was inordinately proud when I picked up the papers last night and this morning and read the reports of your appearance before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. I don't need to tell you what impression you made on the public generally.One report stressed the dignity and sincerity with which you made your statement. In nutshell form, you have stated the case for the American Negro in such a way as to send it around the world in quarters where no other such expression would have received any notice at all. This should be a matter of great pride to you and your wife, even while you realize that there will be sharp criticism and some underhand attacks coming from left-wing or uninformed sources.I am now an old hand at the business of receiving public criticism as well as approbations. I have learned that praise never lasts as long as I would like, but also that criticism is never important when it is delivered by dishonest or uninformed people.The Communist group is exceptionally skilled at kicking up a row that seems to be out of all proportion to their actual numbers among our population. They can fill Madison Square Garden for a rally. They can recruit a hundred people to send a thousand telegrams and letters. They can magnify the squeak of a mouse to the point where it seems like the roar of a lion.I hope that you will expect this kind of result and not be at all disturbed when it occurs. For your information, after the radio and evening newspapers made their comments last night, I circulated for five hours among bars and grills, sidewalk groups and neighbors and friends. It was remarkable that in not one single case did I receive from any person to whom I talked anything but praise for the way in which you had expressed yourself. My experience may have been exceptional in its absence of any criticism, but I am confident that it was typical in its overwhelming preponderance of approval for your point of view.You have rendered a service to our people which will be gratefully regarded for many years to come. On behalf of the National Urban League and the millions of Americans who believe in what we are trying to do, I want to thank you for your service.I hope to improve upon the acquaintanceship--or, I hope, friendship--which we have developed in our contacts. Please give Mrs. Robinson my warm regards.&nbsp;<br>Sincerely yours, Lester B. GrangerROBINSON TO BRANCH RICKEY<i>Robinson considered Rickey to be the father he never had, and he was disappointed when Rickey sold his ownership interest in the Dodgers in 1950 and became general manger of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Robinson refers to Rickey's tenure as general manager of the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1930s and early 1940s.</i>&nbsp;<br>No date [November 1950]&nbsp;<br>Dear Mr. Rickey,&nbsp;<br>I have been intending to write for about a month now and it seems that finding the right words comes hard as I will attempt at this time to put them down.It is certainly tough on everyone in Brooklyn to have you leave the organization but to me it's much worse, and I don't mind saying we (my family) hate to see you go but realize that baseball is like that and anything can happen. It has been the finest experience I have had being associated with you, and I want to thank you very much for all you have meant not only to me and my family but to the entire country and particularly the members of our race. I am glad for your sake that I had a small part to do with the success of your efforts and must admit it was your excellent guidance that enabled me to do it. Regardless of what happens to me in the future, it all can be placed on what you have done and, believe me, I appreciate it.I don't know the circumstances that caused you to sell, but I am smart enough to know that a person does not sell a growing thing unless there is some misunderstanding some place. But I do want to wish you and your family the very best of everything and sincerely hope that you are able to bring to Pittsburgh just what you did to Brooklyn and St. Louis. I hope to end my playing in Brooklyn as it means so very much, but if I have to go any place I hope it can be with you.My wife joins me in saying thanks very much, Mr. Rickey, and we sincerely hope that we can always be regarded as your friends and whenever we need advice we can call on you as usual regardless of where we may be.My very best wishes to you and yours and a hope for your continued success.&nbsp;<br>Sincerely yours, JackieBRANCH RICKEY TO ROBINSONDecember 31, 1950&nbsp;<br>Dear Jackie:&nbsp;<br>It is not at all because of lack of appreciation that I have not acknowledged your good letter of some time ago. Neither your writing and sending the letter, nor its contents, gave me very much surprise. I have observed that you have learned long ago that most things, good or bad, just don't happen to people by accident. Your thoughtfulness in the field of so-called unimportant things has doubtless led to much of your success. Anyhow, the fact that you wrote the letter, and particularly the things you said in it, not only meant very much to me, and was, as I have said, deeply appreciated, but it also revealed why you have come to so much deserved distinction.I hope the day will soon come when it will be entirely possible, as it is entirely right, that you can be considered for administrative work in baseball, particularly in the direction of field management.I do not know of any player in the game today who could, in my judgment, manage a major league club better than yourself. I recently made this statement in the presence of several writers in the course of various remarks, but I have looked in vain for the reporting of the statement.Very often during these holidays, I have thought of you and Rachel and the family. I choose to feel that my acquaintanceship with you has ripened into a very real friendship, growing out of our facing and trying to solve common problems and our continuous record of seeing eye to eye in practically all of these problems that faced us.I do not suppose that our paths will probably parallel again in any close fashion, but I do want you and Rachel to know that always I, and, indeed the family, will have a constant and lasting interest in your welfare and happiness.As I have often expressed to you, I think you carry a great responsibility for your people, and I am sure that you sense the duties resting upon you because of that responsibility, and I cannot close this letter without once more admonishing you to prepare yourself to do a widely useful work, and, at the same time, dignified and effective in the field of public relations. A part of this preparation, and I know you are smiling, for you have already guessed my oft repeated suggestion, is to finish your college course meritoriously, and get your degree. It would be a great pleasure for me to be your agent in placing you in a big job after your playing days are finished. Believe me always.&nbsp;<br>Sincerely yours, Branch RickeyJOHN D. ROCKEFELLER III TO ROBINSON<i>Robinson and his Dodgers teammate Roy Campanella worked together as counselors at the Harlem branch of the YMCA. They also supported the Y by soliciting funds from the Rockefeller family, a longtime benefactor of African American causes.</i>&nbsp;<br>January 18, 1951&nbsp;<br>Dear Mr. Robinson:&nbsp;<br>My son and I enjoyed very much our recent talk with you. I was especially interested to hear about the work you and Mr. Campanella are doing in furthering the boys work program of the Harlem Y.M.C.A.Because of my appreciation not only of the importance of this program but also of the part you personally are playing in it, it gives me real pleasure to send you the enclosed cashier's check drawn to the order of the Harlem Branch as a contribution toward the expense of this program during the current year. Since the Rockefeller Brothers Fund gives to the Y.M.C.A. of the City of New York, my brothers and I havenot felt that we could normally contribute to branches of the "Y" within the city. Because of this you will understand, I am sure, my asking that this gift be reported as having come from an anonymous source.In writing this letter I don't feel that it is complete without an expression of sincere admiration and appreciation of those principles for which you stand personally in American life.&nbsp;<br>Sincerely, John D. Rockefeller"THE TRAVELERS" TO ROBINSON<i>On the day he received this letter, and aware of this threat against his life, Robinson slugged a home run in the first game of a doubleheader at Crosley Field, home of the Cincinnati Reds.

The book also includes a multitude of new stories from North America. There is a continuing trend of clusters of missing people in United States National Parks. The National Park Service has continued with their policy of failing to keep ledgers, track or otherwise document lists of missing people inside their parks and monuments. This edition has cases from Florida, Texas, Hawaii and forty other states. There are new clusters of missing people from Sequoia and Mount Rainier National Park, Three Sisters Wilderness (OR) and Adirondacks (NY). Canada has missing cases from six provinces that are documented. This new book brings further clarity to the missing person issue by examining multiple disappearances of people in small-confined areas and exposing the similarities of their case. David Paulides also exposes a series of coed disappearances that date back to the early 1900&#x2019;s, which have unusual facts surrounding their case. &#x201c;Missing 411-North America and Beyond&#x201d; is the largest and most comprehensive of the trilogy, 472 pages. The Missing 411 series builds upon itself. It is recommended that you read &#x201c;Missing 411-Western United States&#x201d; first, then the eastern version and then &#x201c;North America and Beyond.&#x201d; There is a historical aspect to this issue and there are common elements that run through the disappearances. ����������������������������������������������� One of the early reviews of &#x201c;Missing 411-North America and Beyond&#x201d; was written by New York Times Best Selling author Whitley Strieber: David Paulides has shined a light onto one of the greatest and most disturbing mysteries of our time: the simple and awful fact that people disappear, especially in our national parks, and little effort is made to find them, let alone inform the public about the danger. Even when massive searches are mounted, and people are found, the events surrounding their loss and recovery are often far beyond logical explanation. This is the most comprehensive and expertly presented series of books on the subject ever written, and the latest volume, which includes stories from five countries, is sobering, chilling and far too well researched to ignore.

Until now. With <i>The Patience Stone</i>, Atiq Rahimi gives face and voice to one unforgettable woman&#x2013;and, one could argue, offers her as a proxy for the grievances of millions...it is a rich read, part allegory, part a tale of retribution, part an exploration of honor, love, sex, marriage, war.&nbsp; It is without doubt an important and courageous book.&#x201d; from the introduction by Khaled Hosseini, author of <i>The Kite Runner</i> and <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i><br><br> In Persian folklore, Syngue Sabour is the name of a magical black stone, a patience stone, which absorbs the plight of those who confide in it. It is believed that the day it explodes, after having received too much hardship and pain, will be the day of the Apocalypse. But here, the Syngue Sabour is not a stone but rather a man lying brain-dead with a bullet lodged in his neck. His wife is with him, sitting by his side. But she resents him for having sacrificed her to the war, for never being able to resist the call to arms, for wanting to be a hero, and in the end, after all was said and done, for being incapacitated in a small skirmish. Yet she cares, and she speaks to him. She even talks to him more and more, opening up her deepest desires, pains, and secrets. While in the streets rival factions clash and soldiers are looting and killing around her, she speaks of her life, never knowing if her husband really hears. And it is an extraordinary confession, without restraint, about sex and love and her anger against a man who never understood her, who mistreated her, who never showed her any respect or kindness. Her admission releases the weight of oppression of marital, social, and religious norms, and she leads her story up to the great secret that is unthinkable in a country such as Afghanistan. Winner of the Prix Goncourt, <i>The Patience Stone </i>captures with great courage and spare, poetic, prose the reality of everyday life for an intelligent woman under the oppressive weight of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.</p><p><b>Atiq Rahimi </b>was born in Afghanistan in 1962, but fled to France in 1984.

Bare of decoration. Except on the wall between the two windows, where someone has hung a small <b><i>khanjar </i></b>and, above the khanjar, a photo, of a man with a moustache. He is perhaps thirty years old. Curly hair. Square face, bracketed by a pair of neatly tended sideburns. His black eyes shine. They are small, separated by a hawklike nose. The man is not laughing, and yet seems as if he&#x2019;s holding back a laugh. This gives him a strange expression, that of a man inwardly mocking those who look at him. The photo is in black and white, hand-colored in drab tones. Facing this photo, at the foot of a wall, the same man&#x2013;older now&#x2013;is lying on a red mattress on the floor. He has a beard. Pepper and salt. He is thinner. Too thin. Nothing but skin and bones. Pale.Wrinkled. His nose more hawklike than ever. He still isn&#x2019;t laughing, and still looks strangely mocking. His mouth is half-open. His eyes, even smaller now, have retreated into their sockets. His gaze is fixed on the ceiling, on the exposed, blackened, rotting beams. His arms lie passive along his sides. Beneath the translucent skin, his veins like exhausted worms twine around the jutting bones of his body. On his left wrist he wears a wind-up watch, and on the ring finger a gold wedding band.

But it is also a poetry that insists on angry intelligence over world-weary head-shaking. -- Publishers Weekly. For a poet to be collected like this, at the age of fifty in mid-career, is unusual, but not for Reading -- prolific, distinctive and controversial. His is an epic lament for a species given to cruelty and self-destruction. Generally, rhyme provides the backbone for public poetry. What sets Reading apart is his use of mostly classical dactylic meter, with Latin hexameters, couplets, and older Greek forms.</p><p></p><h2>The Sagebrush Ocean, Tenth Anniversary Edition: A Natural History Of The Great Basin (Max C. Fleischmann Series in Great Basin Natural History.)</h2><p>Noted writer and photographer Stephen Trimble mixes eloquent accounts of personal experiences with clear explication of natural history. His photographs capture some of the most spectacular but least-known scenery in the western states. The Great Basin Desert sweeps from the Sierra to the Rockies, from the Snake River Plain to the Mojave Desert. "Biogeography" would be one way to sum up Trimble's focus on the land: what lives where, and why. He introduces concepts of desert ecology and discusses living communities of animals and plants that band Great Basin mountains&#x2014;from the exhilarating emptiness of dry lake-beds to alpine regions at the summits of the 13,000-foot Basin ranges.<p>This is the best general introduction to the ecology and spirit of the Great Basin, a place where "the desert almost seems to mirror the sky in size," where mountains hold "ravens, bristlecone pines, winter stillness&#x2014;and unseen, but satisfying, the possibility of bighorn sheep." Trimble's photographs come from the backcountry of this rugged land, from months of exploring and hiking the Great Basin wilderness in all seasons; and his well-chosen words come from a rare intimacy with the West.</p></p><p>Salt Lake City writer, photographer, and naturalist Stephen Trimble has received significant awards for his nonfiction, his photography, and his fiction. Trimble received both the Sierra Club&#39;s Ansel Adams Award and the High Desert Museum&#39;s Earle A. Chiles Award for The Sagebrush Ocean.

It lasted only 12. But those 12 years contained some of the most catastrophic events Western civilization has ever known. In The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, William L. Shirer gave us the definitive book on Hitler&#39;s German Empire. Based on his personal experiences as a war correspondent as well as the voluminous documents that came out of Germany after the war, this thrilling account of Hitler&#39;s reign is widely acclaimed to be one of the greatest historical works of our time. Now available as an exclusive anniversary edition, this volume is as compelling as ever. Everything about the period is explained to the fullest, beginning with Hitler&#39;s rise to power, the Nazification of Germany and the march to war.

One writer recalled Tresca as a &#x201c;labor spellbinder,&#x201d; citing his ability to whip up a crowd of workers with fiery oratory. <br>In January 1943, Tresca found himself in the middle of a fight to determine the future of his beloved homeland, Italy. The Allied invasion of Sicily&#x2014;the initial thrust in the battle to break the Axis in half&#x2014;remained six months in the future. But it was already clear to anyone with a modicum of awareness that the days were numbered for Benito Mussolini&#x2019;s fascist ruling order. Tresca adamantly demanded that the still-aborning postwar Italian government be free of both former fascists and eager-to-dominate communists. <br>Tresca habitually found himself in the middle of public political fights. A thin-faced firebrand born in the Abruzzo in 1879, he wore a Trotsky-like beard and, after moving to America in 1904, helped organize strikes for the Wobblies, the International Workers of the World. Tresca&#x2019;s personal politics matured like a rogue Chianti, beginning with nationalism, proceeding through socialism, finally to arrive at a vinegary style of anarchism. His newspaper, <i>Il Martello</i> (the Hammer), had carried on the battle against Mussolini since 1920. The Spanish Civil War and the Russo-German nonaggression pact had soured him on Stalin and the communists. <br>While agitating against Mussolini and the fascists as well as against Stalin and the communists, Tresca also fought the mob. He vehemently opposed organized crime&#x2019;s infiltration of trade unions. Since the days of the Black Hand, the original Italian crime syndicate, Tresca had battled the mob in his adopted home of America. <br>Tresca&#x2019;s enemies were legion. In 1931, Mussolini put the rabble-rouser on his &#x201c;death list.&#x201d; The man had been repeatedly beaten, threatened, and targeted for assassination. The first try was in 1909 by a razor-wielding assailant in Pittsburgh, who missed Tresca&#x2019;s throat but slashed through his cheek and jaw. <br>Tresca didn&#x2019;t quit. An odd alliance occurred in WWII Italy. In the prewar years Mussolini had mounted an impressive assault on the entrenched Mafia, in Sicily and elsewhere in Italy, shattering its century-old hold in many parts of the country, hounding its soldiers into exile. <br>Yet, in the early 1940s, one of the powerful figures in Il Duce&#x2019;s orbit was an Italian-American mafioso named Vito Genovese. And it was this man&#x2014;the same fedora-wearing figure Ed Croswell would spot inside a Chrysler Imperial limo at Apalachin&#x2014;whom Carlo Tresca decided deserved special attention. <br>Born near Naples in 1897, Vito Genovese emigrated with his family in 1913 to the Lower East Side. There he formed a friendship that would shape his life, meeting one Salvatore Lucania, who as Lucky Luciano would come to be known as the premier organizer of organized crime in America. The same age, Lucky and Vito represented the classic mob combination of brains and brawn, respectively. <br>As a young turk in the twenties&#x2019; and thirties&#x2019; mob, Genovese cut a violent swath across New York City and its environs. His rap sheet reads like a true gangster r�sum�: homicide, disorderly person, burglary, homicide, carrying a dangerous weapon, homicide. These were only the crimes that came to police notice&#x2014;there were others, infamous and bloody. The judicial dispositions of the arrests were equally interesting: discharged, dismissed, discharged, discharged, dismissed, discharged. <br>In 1936, in flight from the heat over one of these murders, Genovese decamped for the homeland, settling in Nola, near Naples. He prospered. He helped lay the groundwork for the Marseilles-Cuba-Montreal &#x201c;triangle trade&#x201d; in heroin smuggling. He cultivated contacts in Fascist leadership circles in Italy. His legitimate bona fides developed to the degree that he became part owner of several factories, power plants, and a castle in Campania. <br>None of this sat well with Carlo Tresca. He had a run-in with Genovese in 1935, when the mobster wanted to open a fascist-friendly club for Italian seamen in New York City. Tresca, an avowed antifascist, put the kibosh on the plan. Later, when he heard of Genovese&#x2019;s activities in Italy, Tresca reasoned that the only way the gangster could be accepted by higher-ups was through ignorance of his past. He fired off a series of letters to the government, detailing Vito&#x2019;s unsavory background in America. <br>Vito Genovese was not a man to be trifled with, especially not by a left-leaning anarchist journalist with multiple political axes to grind. According to an anonymous informant, Genovese had the following conversation with Il Duce at a 1942 Christmas party in Rome. <br>&#x201c;Carlo Tresca is an archenemy of mine,&#x201d; Mussolini said to Genovese. <br>&#x201c;Mine, too,&#x201d; Genovese said, agreeing with the dictator that Tresca had bothered too many powerful people for too long. <br>&#x201c;If there is anything you can do to rid us of him,&#x201d; Mussolini said, &#x201c;I would do anything in the world for you.&#x201d; <br>Some two weeks after this exchange, on the evening of Monday, January 11, 1943, Tresca worked late at the <i>Il Martello</i> office on the third floor of a six-story commercial building at 96 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, on the southwest corner of Fifteenth Street. He had finished a busy day, huddling with associates, discussing plans to disrupt a meeting of the Office of War Information the following Thursday, seeing writer John Dos Passos for lunch, meeting with a job seeker, an engraver, staffers at the newspaper. <br>At around nine p.m., a lawyer named Giuseppe Calabi arrived at the <i>Il Martello</i> offices. He and Tresca had a committee meeting planned, but the other members didn&#x2019;t show up, so the editor suggested the two men go for a meal at a nearby bar. They left the building via a Fifteenth Street exit and turned toward Fifth Avenue. <br>Wartime gas rationing and blackout rules meant the cross street was very dark. As Tresca and Calabi headed east, a gunman stepped out of the shadows behind them and fired&#x2014;a single shot, then three more in quick succession. <br>Two bullets hit Tresca, either of which would have been fatal, one tearing through his left lung and one penetrating the right side of his face to lodge in his spine. He dropped to the pavement, his legs cocked awkwardly, feet splaying to the curb. Witnesses&#x2014;two workers from the nearby Norwegian consulate&#x2014;reported a black Ford sedan pulling away down Fifteenth after the shooting. <br>Carlo Tresca, activist, anarchist, friend to the workingman, was pronounced dead on arrival at St. Vincent&#x2019;s Hospital, four blocks from the murder scene. <br>That should have been that. A man with many enemies gunned down on the street, an anarchist killed amid the kind of lawless chaos he himself advocated. The list of likely suspects was long. <br>But the murder of Carlo Tresca would become a tiny ringing bell, vibrating, dinging, pealing, setting off sympathetic tremors, triggering expanding circles of effect that passed through the echelons of American law enforcement until it arrived, years later, within the patient, long-memoried reach of Sergeant Edgar Croswell. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>&#x201c;La Marese,&#x201d; they called them&#x2014;the Mafia soldiers and bosses from Castellammare del Golfo, Sicily. If Italy is the boot kicking the Sicilian football, then Castellammare is the northwest tip of the ball. <br>A rough declension played itself out among Italians in the mob in America, dividing them into two camps. There were the Castellammarese, from the insular, secretive commune in Sicily, and then there were immigrants with backgrounds in and around Naples, the provinces of Calabria and Campania. <br>It wasn&#x2019;t black and white, and there were exceptions hailing from all over Italy, but generally the division held true. The styles could be said to be different, too. La Marese and Neapolitan, the heart and the head, the fiery emotional and the coolly rational. Again, nothing set in stone, just a vague stereotype, both true and untrue in the way of all stereotypes. <br>The opposing clans banged and bloodied each other in the fabled Castellammarese War at the dawn of the 1930s, a revenge-fest that left sixty gangsters dead. <br>In the heat of battle, factions proved fluid and situational. Mobsters regularly killed their allies and made alliances with their enemies. Younger, more assimilated gangsters used the war to further their ambitions, displacing the older, more traditional &#x201c;Mustache Petes&#x201d; of the first immigrant generation. When the smoke of the Castellammarese War cleared, clearly the mobster who benefited most was the Sicilian organizational genius, Charles &#x201c;Lucky&#x201d; Luciano. <br>Luciano ushered the Mafia into a new era. The mob evolved from an ethnic-based society preying on immigrant enclaves into a well-oiled syndicate reaping illicit profits from nearly every sector of the American economy. Luciano forged a pan-ethnic alliance with Jewish gangster Meyer Lansky. Borders were crossed, divisions were abandoned, and organized crime went national. <br>Another casualty of the Castellammarese War in-fighting was the old &#x201c;honored society&#x201d; tradition that forbade any involvement in narcotics and prostitution. The gangland battles foreshadowed the end of Prohibition in 1933 and, like any forward-thinking corporate boss, Luciano realized new revenue streams had to be developed. Dope and sex fit the bill. <br>By the fifties, the division of the mob along geographical lines had increasingly faded, but still held on as an inherited vestige. The Sicilians Joe Bonanno, Joe Profaci, Steven Magaddino, and Frank Garafalo lined up as La Marese, while Vito Genovese, Frank Costello, and Albe...</p><h2>Knots Untied</h2><p>Strong meat for the hungry Christian, and Protestant to the bone&#x2014;&#x201c;Knots Untied&#x201d; is J.C. Ryle&#x2019;s &#x201c;honest effort to untie some theological knots, and to supply some clear statements of truth.&#x201d;</p><p>"Knots Untied" is the first book in a four volume series written by J.C. Ryle; the other titles being "Practical Religion," "Old Paths," and "Holiness." <p>While most people are usually familiar with the latter three (especially "Holiness"), "Knots Untied" has for the most part fallen by the wayside. The irony here is that "Knots" went through ten editions in its first eleven years, and to this day many consider it to be J.C. Ryle's magnum opus! </p><p>Because &#x201c;Knots&#x201d; is a systematic defense of confessional Christianity, as opposed to the chaos which marks the modern church, perhaps it could be argued that its fall in popularity is simply a reflection of contemporary Christians&#x2019; antagonism to orthodoxy. However this may be, one thing is certain: &#x201c;Knots Untied&#x201d; is a remarkable witness for the evangelical faith&#x2014;a witness that if heeded could only benefit the Church.</p></p><h2>More William (Just William)</h2><p>Excerpt: ... her. &#34;I want William Brown to hold the queen&#39;s train,&#34; said Miss Dewhurst. &#34;Me?&#34; ejaculated William in horror. &#34;D&#39;you mean me?&#34; &#34;Yes, dear.

It tells of a typical day for each animal--lamb, pig, puppy, kitten, horse, bird--on a small farm. This new, larger version has been edited and modernized. The original included some wild creatures (a flounder and some bear cubs) that have been omitted from the new edition. The text has been updated (i.e., the child's heavy lunch of meat, potatoes, juice, vegetables, and dessert has been changed to a light lunch of soup, milk, and dessert; sexist allusions--"it is nighttime, and the fathers are coming home"--are gone). Mary Cameron's outdated pictures for the original edition have been replaced by Jeffers' familiar, colorful watercolor and pen-and-ink paintings which capture, in true picture-book style, a modern black family's farm day. Paintings and text are interspersed on each page, creating a lovely whole. Illustrations range from full-page and double-page spreads to several smaller ones on a page surrounded by crisp white space. Young children will delight in the lilting, often repetitive, question-and-answer format of the text. Despite several flaws (size relationships are not always correct; far too many sentences begin with and and but ), this new edition of Brown's long out-of-print title will find a ready audience in those same young readers who enjoy her other books. --Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, Ohio<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc."It is morning, and everything is waking up. / Birds are waking up the way birds wake up. / Pigs are waking up the way pigs wake up. / And children are waking up too." A black girl in a farmhouse has breakfast and gets dressed before helping her parents feed and care for the lambs, puppies and kittens that have also just begun their day. While the baby animals are eating lunch, the girl eats, too. And in the evening, everyone--baby animals and child--must go to sleep. Brown's story, first published in 1941, has the same comforting repetition found in Good night Moon , although this text is much longer. Jeffers's watercolor illustrations, with detailed work in ink, let readers join the reassuring world where animals and children are loved and cared for. The juxtaposition of pictures and white space to text, and the use of soft, spring-like colors, give the design a spacious, welcoming look.

Though Laake is now a professional journalist, she was raised in a Mormon family and sent to Brigham Young University with one paramount aim: to find and marry ``a faithful Mormon man.'' Without such a marriage, plus the guidance that only a devout husband could provide, she would ``be denied access to the highest level of Mormon heaven''--just one of the many unusual aspects of the emphatically patriarchal religion that Laake reveals here. Moreover, the author intended to wed not any man but ``the One''- -the marriage partner predestined by God--and when she began to doubt that one narrow-minded but extraordinarily persistent suitor, Monty Brown, was the One, Monty and Laake's own brother rushed to her side to exorcise ``the devil'' that had invaded her soul. Laake married Monty in an arcane ceremony whose esoteric details are zestfully described here; pledged to wear ``garments'' (a kind of sanctified nightgown) for the rest of her life; and began what most Americans would consider a bizarre life that included the recycling of condoms through vigorous washing. Within nine months, the naturally free-spirited author asked for a divorce and began--under the close (and, by her account, sexually obsessed) scrutiny of male church authorities--a painful odyssey of self-liberation that included two further marriages, two nervous breakdowns with hospitalization, and the slow recognition of her worth as a woman.

After Flossie's father joins the army, the nine-year-old girl is left to care for both her baby brother and her great-uncle. In a collage-style diary merging photos, postcards, and other memorabilia, Flossie relays events ranging from the arrival of evacuees to the wrenching news that her cousin has been killed. Her vibrant first-person narration reveals a humor and a fihting spirit that sees her through many a hardship until she welcomes her dad home at last.</p><p>Marcia Williams, the author-illustrator of ARCHIE&#39;S WAR, has retold many classic tales in her signature comic-book style. She is also the author-illustrator of GOD AND HIS CREATIONS and HOORAY FOR INVENTORS! She lives in London.Grade 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;Following <i>Archie's War</i> (Candlewick, 2007), a fictional scrapbook of World War I, Williams offers an intricately designed and intimate look at World War II, as seen through the eyes of Archie's daughter. In her "secret war diary" that chronicles the years 1939 through 1945, motherless Flossie shares her thoughts in entries filled with humor and angst. She lives in the Dorset countryside in the gardener's cottage on a small estate with her great uncle and younger brother while her father is serving in the British army. Children will quickly come to enjoy Flossie's energetic delivery and endless doodling. They will love poring over the extras&#x2014;asides, sidebars, and letters found under flaps and in envelopes, that Williams has compiled to give the book the feel that one has stumbled into a real girl's private keepsake. The book's font&#x2014;called Flossie&#x2014;is a mix of printing and cursive that adds to the authenticity but may pose a challenge for some readers. While many American children will not be familiar with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and singer Vera Lynn, they will come away with a great appreciation for the sacrifices of the English people as well as their resolve to carry on until peace reigns again. Children who enjoy history will be fascinated by Flossie and will undoubtedly be inspired to learn more about the events she describes.&#x2014;<i>Maura Bresnahan, High Plain Elementary School, Andover, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Wodehouse</h2><p><p>Bertie Wooster (a young man about town) and his butler Jeeves (the very model of the modern manservant)&#x2015;return in their first new novel in nearly forty years: <i>Jeeves and the Wedding Bells</i> by Sebastian Faulks. </p><p>P.G. Wodehouse documented the lives of the inimitable Jeeves and Wooster for nearly sixty years, from their first appearance in 1915 ("Extricating Young Gussie") to his final completed novel (<i>Aunts Aren</i><i>'</i><i>t Gentlemen</i>) in 1974. These two were the finest creations of a novelist widely proclaimed to be the finest comic English writer by critics and fans alike. </p><p>Now, forty years later, Bertie and Jeeves return in a hilarious affair of mix-ups and mishaps. With the approval of the Wodehouse estate, acclaimed novelist Sebastian Faulks brings these two back to life for their legion of fans. Bertie, nursing a bit of heartbreak over the recent engagement of one Georgina Meadowes to someone <i>not</i> named Wooster, agrees to "help" his old friend Peregrine "Woody" Beeching, whose own romance is foundering. That this means an outing to Dorset, away from an impending visit from Aunt Agatha, is merely an extra benefit. Almost immediately, things go awry and the simple plan quickly becomes complicated. Jeeves ends up impersonating one Lord Etringham, while Bertie pretends to be Jeeves' manservant "Wilberforce,"&#x2015;and this all happens under the same roof as the now affianced Ms. Meadowes. From there the plot becomes even more hilarious and convoluted, in a brilliantly conceived, seamlessly written comic work worthy of the master himself.</p><p>A <i>Kirkus Reviews </i>Best Fiction Book of 2013</p></p><p><p><b>SEBASTIAN FAULKS</b> is the author of twelve novels, including <i>A Week in December</i><i>; A Possible Life; Human Traces; On Green Dolphin Street; Charlotte Gray,</i> which was made into a film starring Cate Blanchett; and the classic <i>Birdsong</i>, which has sold more than three million copies and was recently adapted for television. In 2008, he was invited to write a James Bond novel, <i>Devil May Care</i>, to mark the centenary of Ian Fleming. He lives in London with his wife and their three children.</p>*Starred Review* What, ho?! This blighter Faulks, after making a reasonably good show of posing as Ian Fleming (Devil May Care, 2009), has the unmitigated gall to take a run at impersonating the inimitable P. G., the very incarnation of sui generis? Doesn&#x2019;t he know that Wodehouseans far and wide, well born and less so, will be sharpening their incisors for the chance to take a chomp at the hindquarters of the cheeky upstart? But wait. Hold off, old sports. Young Faulksie just may have the gray matter to make a go of it. The first order of business when attempting to offer homage to Sir Pelham Grenville is to construct a plot as screwball crazy as anything Shakespeare ever concocted in the Forest of Arden (disguises, mistaken identities, catastrophic kerfuffles all de rigueur); next is to plop bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster in the middle of the muddle; and, finally, of course, it&#x2019;s necessary to set Bertie&#x2019;s unflappable manservant, the all-knowing Jeeves, to the herculean task of making it all work. Faulksie&#x2019;s plot is spot on: Bertie&#x2019;s pal, Peregrine Woody Beeching, has been dumped by his beloved, but Bertie is on the case. The plan, for reasons only a savvy Hegelian could fathom, involves Bertie posing as a manservant and Jeeves as his master. Brilliant stroke, that, allowing Jeeves to show his stuff at dinner-table chitchat and Bertie to, well, spill the gravy. Naturally, it all takes place at a country house (Wodehouse&#x2019;s Forest of Arden), and, equally naturally, Miss Georgiana Meadowes, who makes Bertie&#x2019;s heart go pitty-pat, is also in attendance. OK, fine, this P. G. poseur gets the plot right, but what about the all-important patter, the Bertie-isms and the priceless Bertie-Jeeves dialogue duets? But Faulksie nails it again, evoking rather than imitating, but doing so in perfect pitch. Finally, old-timers will doubtless recoil in horror at the shocking conclusion, but let&#x2019;s all loosen our stuffed shirts and let the new guy have his way. Top drawer.

At the heart of this taut, psychological, action-packed thriller set in the early 1940s is Thomas, an exceptional 11-year-old boy whose mind, a well-oiled, precise "machine," contains the complicated codes to 724 secret Swiss bank accounts, a fortune the Nazis have been trying to get at for many years. Their operative is a 46-year-old professor of philosophy, reputed to be the most intelligent man in the Third Reich. Like two chess grand masters, the hunter and his quarry ingeniously outmaneuver each other, each understanding the superior intelligence of his opponent and able to anticipate the other's moves several steps in advance. The drama is heightened by the boy's intense relationships with his beautiful and elusive mother, who trained him for his mission, and with his almost-invisible Spanish bodyguards and a network of supporters from France, Switzerland and Spain set up by her in advance. Particularly poignant is Thomas's relationship with a well-connected American banker who did not know of the boy's existence until asked by the woman he once loved to endanger his own life to save his son's. As sensitive as he is intelligent, Thomas guards against attachment to the man who is his father: too many people he has loved have been savagely murdered by the Nazis. Durand has written several French bestsellers under a pseudonym; Daddy , the first work published in the U.S. under his real name, was a leading bestseller in France. Considering the mastery he displays in this popular genre, readers will anxiously await more.

The "old logic" is still the natural logic of the four language arts (reading, writing, speaking, and listening). Symbolic, or "mathematical," logic may be superior to classical "ordinary-language" Aristotelian logic for the sciences, but not for the humanities, and is more sophisticated theoretically but not more useful practically. (How often have you heard non-philosophers argue in symbolic logic?)</p><p>(2) This book is simple and user-friendly. It is highly interactive, with a plethora of exercises and a light, engaging style. Most beginners need a "back to basics" logic text rather than the latest overpriced one with state-of-the-art "bells and whistles" that they will never use outside class.</p><p>(3) It is practical. It is designed for do-it-yourselfers as well as classrooms. It emphasizes topics in proportion to probable student use: e.g., interpreting ordinary language, not only analyzing but also constructing effective arguments, smoking out hidden assumptions, making "argument maps," and using Socratic method in various circumstances. It is divided into eighty-eight mini-chapters for maximum mix-and-match flexibility.</p><p>(4) It is also philosophical. Its exercises expose students to many classical quotations, and additional chapters introduce philosophical issues in a Socratic manner and from a common-sense, realistic point of view. It prepares students for reading Great Books rather than Dick and Jane, and models Socrates as the beginner's ideal teacher and philosopher.</p></p><p>Peter Kreeft is the author of over 40 books, including A Refutation of Moral Relativism, Summa of the Summa, Christianity for Modern Pagans: A Commentary on Pascal&#39;s Pense�s, andC.S.

He sheds light on often-troubling images and descriptions, helping readers feel as if they understand the message of Revelation. An appendix describes the rich significance of the many numbers appearing in Revelation, and the scripture index aids readers in finding answers to their specific questions.</p><p><b>Herbert Lockyer</b> (1886-1985) was an internationally known preacher and the author of approximately fifty books. A British Baptist minister, he graduated from Glasgow Bible College and received doctoral degrees from Northwestern Evangelical seminary and the International Academy in London.<p></p><p>Rev. <b>Herbert Lockyer, Jr.</b> is the Executive Minister, Emeritus at First Presbyterian Church. He received his M.A. from Loyala University, Chicago and worked with his father on the "All Series."</p></p><h2>Evidentiary Foundations</h2><p>Covering all major evidentiary doctrines, the text provides a blueprint for introduction of evidence at trial. It enables the student to convert a sentence in the Federal Rules of Evidence into a line of questioning to be used at trial. A useful companion to a coursebook in Evidence or Trial Practice, <b>Evidentiary Foundations</b> enables the student to picture the manner in which the rules of evidence operate. After a brief narrative discussion, the book dissects each major evidentiary doctrine into a list of foundational elements. The book then sets out an illustrative foundation, establishing all the predicate elements. This foundation gives the student a more concrete understanding of the evidence rule to which the foundation relates. The Eighth Edition not only updates the narrative discussion with recent citations; even more importantly, the new edition also includes an analysis of the processes of laying foundations and introducing evidence in courtrooms with modern computer technology.</p><p></p><h2>A New Deal for the World: America&#39;s Vision for Human Rights</h2><p><p> In a work of sweeping scope and luminous detail, Elizabeth Borgwardt describes how a cadre of World War II American planners inaugurated the ideas and institutions that underlie our modern international human rights regime. </p><p> Borgwardt finds the key in the 1941 Atlantic Charter and its Anglo-American vision of "war and peace aims." In attempting to globalize what U.S. planners heralded as domestic New Deal ideas about security, the ideology of the Atlantic Charter--buttressed by FDR's "Four Freedoms" and the legacies of World War I--redefined human rights and America's vision for the world. </p><p> Three sets of international negotiations brought the Atlantic Charter blueprint to life--Bretton Woods, the United Nations, and the Nuremberg trials. These new institutions set up mechanisms to stabilize the international economy, promote collective security, and implement new thinking about international justice. The design of these institutions served as a concrete articulation of U.S. national interests, even as they emphasized the importance of working with allies to achieve common goals. The American architects of these charters were attempting to redefine the idea of security in the international sphere. To varying degrees, these institutions and the debates surrounding them set the foundations for the world we know today. </p><p> By analyzing the interaction of ideas, individuals, and institutions that transformed American foreign policy--and Americans' view of themselves--Borgwardt illuminates the broader history of modern human rights, trade and the global economy, collective security, and international law. This book captures a lost vision of the American role in the world. </p></p><p><b>Elizabeth Borgwardt</b> is Associate Professor of History at Washington University in St. Louis.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/BORNEW_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>Bobby the Brain: Wrestling&#39;s Bad Boy Tells All</h2><p><p><i>Bobby the Brain</i> unleashes the life story of Bobby Heenan, better known as &#x201c;The Brain&#x201d; in wrestling circles.

As divine messengers, symbols of our yearning for the heavens, or avatars of glorious song and colour, birds have stirred our imaginations from the moment we first looked up into the sky.<br><br>Whether as the Christian dove, or the Aztec Quetzalcoatl, or in Plato&#x2019;s representation of the human soul growing wings and feathers, religion and philosophy have looked to birds as representatives of our best selves &#x2014; that part of us not bound to the earth.<br><br>With the devotion of a birder and hoarder of words, Gibson has spent twenty years collecting the literary and artistic forms our affinity for birds has taken over the centuries. Birds appear again and again in mythology and folk tales and in literature by writers as diverse as Aesop, Shakespeare, Poe, Coleridge, Borges, and Eliot. They&#x2019;ve been omens, allegories, disguises and guides; they&#x2019;ve been worshipped, eaten, feared, and loved. Nor does Gibson forget the fascination birds hold for science, as the Galapagos finches did for Darwin. Birds appear charmingly and tellingly in the work of such naturalists as W.H. Hudson, Peter Matthiessen, Farley Mowat, and Barry Lopez.<br><br>So intensely and universally are we drawn to birds, it&#x2019;s small wonder that birdwatching is one of the most popular activities in the English-speaking world. <br><br>Gorgeously illustrated and woven from centuries of human response to the delights of the feathered tribes, <b>The Bedside Book of Birds</b> is for everyone who is passionate about birds and all they mean to humanity.<br><i>&#x201c;With the zeal of a convert and the instigated imagination of an ex-novelist, I started taking note of, then collecting, and finally obsessively searching out texts that illustrated something &#x2014; almost anything &#x2014; about our human response to birds. This book is the result. It isn&#x2019;t so much about birds themselves as it is about the richly varied relationships we have established with them during the hundreds of thousands of years that we and they have shared life on earth.&#x201d;</i><br>&#x2014;Graeme Gibson</p><p>Birds have always created a sense of wonder and reverence in their earth-bound human observers. They are featured in creation myths of many different civilizations and appear with great frequency in fairy tales and fables the world over. Associated with creativity and freedom, with the spirit as opposed to the body, birds have been powerful symbols in religious traditions through the ages, from Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec plumed serpent, to the Christian dove. In all times and in every culture, they have inspired great works of literature and great works of art. Science, too, has looked toward the avian world for keys to understanding the nature of life on earth. <br>THE BEDSIDE BOOK OF BIRDS, an unprecedented and enchanting treasure trove of paintings, drawings, poems, essays, and scientific observations, beautifully captures the interest and emotions birds evoke. The illustrations range from early cave paintings to Audubon's famous portraits to abstract works created in the twentieth century. There are writings by Shakespeare, Coleridge, Poe, Ted Hughes, and Jorge Luis Borges, among many others. Excerpts from famous scientific works, including Darwin's observations on the tameness of the Galapagos Islands' birds, are here, too, along with charming and valuable pieces by such popular nature writers as W. H. Hudson, Peter Matthiessen, Farley Mowat, and Barry Lopez. It is a book to ponder, to savor, and to learn from, for the winged soul in all of us.Graeme Gibson is the acclaimed author of <b>Communion</b>, <b>Perpetual Motion</b>, and <b>Gentleman Death</b>.

In the evenings I sat on the back steps of a rented shotgun house on Bayou Teche and watched the boats passing in the twilight and listened to the Sunset Limited blowing down the line. Just as the light went out of the sky the moon would rise like an orange planet above the oaks that covered my rented backyard, then I would go inside and fix supper for myself and eat alone at the kitchen table.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But in my heart the autumnal odor of gas on the wind, the gold and dark green of the trees, and the flame-lit edges of the leaves were less a sign of Indian summer than a prelude to winter rains and the short, gray days of December and January, when smoke would plume from stubble fires in the cane fields and the sun would be only a yellow vapor in the west.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Years ago, in both New Orleans and New Iberia, the tannic hint of winter and the amber cast of the shrinking days gave me the raison d'etre I needed to drink in any saloon that would allow me inside its doors. I was not one of those valiant, alcoholic souls who tries to drink with a self-imposed discipline and a modicum of dignity, either. I went at it full-bore, knocking back Beam or Black Jack straight-up in sawdust bars where I didn't have to make comparisons, with a long-necked Jax or Regal on the side that would take away the aftertaste and fill my mouth with golden needles. Each time I tilted the shotglass to my lips I saw in my mind's eye a simian figure feeding a fire inside a primeval cave and I felt no regret that I shared his enterprise.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Now I went to meetings and didn't drink anymore, but I had a way of putting myself inside bars, usually ones that took me back to the Louisiana in which I had grown up. One of my favorites of years past was Goldie Bierbaum's place on Magazine in New Orleans. A green colonnade extended over the sidewalk, and the rusted screen doors still had painted on them the vague images and lettering of Depression-era coffee and bread advertisements. The lighting was bad, the wood floor scrubbed colorless with bleach, the railed bar interspersed with jars of pickles and hard-boiled eggs above and cuspidors down below. And Goldie himself was a jewel out of the past, a seventy-year-old flat-chested ex-prizefighter who had fought Cleveland Williams and Eddie Machen.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It was night and raining hard on the colonnade and tin roof of </p><p></p><p></p><p>the building. I sat at the far end of the bar, away from the door, with </p><p></p><p></p><p>a demitasse of coffee and a saucer and tiny spoon in front of me. Through the front window I could see Clete Purcel parked in his lavender Cadillac convertible, a fedora shadowing his face in the glow of the streetlight. A man came in and removed his raincoat and sat down on the other end of the bar. He was young, built like a weight-lifter whose physique was earned rather than created with steroids. He wore his brown hair shaved on the sides, with curls hanging down the back of his neck. His eyebrows were half-moons, his face impish, cartoonlike, as though it were drawn with a charcoal pencil.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Goldie poured him a shot and a draft chaser, then set the whiskey bottle back on the counter against the wall and pretended to read the newspaper. The man finished his drink and walked the length of the bar to the men's room in back. His eyes looked straight ahead and showed no interest in me as he passed.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"That's the guy," Goldie said, leaning close to me.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"You're sure? No mistake?" I said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"He comes in three nights a week for a shot and a beer, sometimes a catfish po'boy. I heard him talking about it on the payphone back there. Maybe he's not the guy who hurt your friend, but how many guys in New Orleans are gonna be talking about breaking the spokes on a Catholic priest?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>I heard the men's room door open again and footsteps walk past me to the opposite end of the bar. Goldie's eyes became veiled, impossible to read. The top of his head looked like an alabaster bowling ball with blue lines in it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry about your wife. It was last year?" he said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I nodded.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"It was lupus?" he said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Yeah, that's right," I replied.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"You doin' all right?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Sure," I said, avoiding his eyes.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Don't get in no trouble, like we used to do in the old days."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Not a chance," I said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Hey, my po'boy ready?" the man at the end of the bar asked.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The man made a call on the payphone, then ate his sandwich and bounced pool balls off the rails on the pool table. The mirror behind the bar was oxidized an oily green and yellow, like the color of lubricant floating in water, and between the liquor bottles lined along the mirror I could see the man looking at the back of my head.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I turned on the bar stool and grinned at him. He waited for me to speak. But I didn't.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I know you?" he said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Maybe. I used to live in New Orleans. I don't anymore," I said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>He spun the cue ball down the rail into the pocket, his eyes lowered. "So you want to shoot some nine ball?" he said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I'd be poor competition."</p><p></p><p></p><p>He didn't raise his eyes or look at me again. He finished his beer and sandwich at the bar, then put on his coat and stood at the screen door, looking at the mist blowing under the colonnade and at the cars passing in the neon-streaked wetness in front of Goldie's bar. Clete Purcel fired up his Cadillac and rattled down the street, turning at the end of the block.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The man with the impish face and curls that hung on the back of his neck stepped outside and breathed the air like a man out for a walk, then got into a Honda and drove up Magazine toward the Garden District. A moment later Clete Purcel pulled around the block and picked me up.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Can you catch him?" I asked.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I don't have to. That's Gunner Ardoin. He lives in a dump off Tchoupitoulas," he said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Gunner? He's a button man?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"No, he's been in two or three of Fat Sammy Figorelli's porn films. He mules crystal in the projects, too."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Would he bust up a priest?" I asked.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Clete looked massive behind the steering wheel, his upper arms like big, cured hams inside his tropical shirt. His hair was sandy, cut short like a little boy's. A diagonal scar ran through his left eyebrow.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Gunner?" he said. "It doesn't sound like him. But a guy who performs oral sex for a hometown audience? Who knows?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>We caught up with the Honda at Napoleon Avenue, then followed it through a dilapidated neighborhood of narrow streets and shot-gun houses to Tchoupitoulas. The driver turned on a side street and parked under a live oak in front of a darkened cottage. He walked up a shell driveway and entered the back door with a key and turned on a light inside.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Clete circled the block, then parked four houses up the street from Gunner Ardoin's place and cut the engine. He studied my face.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"You look a little wired," he said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Not me," I said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The rain on the windshield made rippling shadows on his face and arms. "I made my peace with N.O.P.D.," he said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Really?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Most of the guys who did us dirt are gone. I let it be known I'm not in the O.K. Corral business anymore. It makes life a lot easier," he said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Through the overhang of the trees I could see the Missi...</p></p><h2>The Second Spy: The Books of Elsewhere, Vol. 3</h2><p><b>In Olive's third adventure in the<i> New York Times</i> bestselling Books of Elsewhere series, what lurks below the house could be as dangerous as what's hidden inside. . . </b><br><br>Some terrifying things have happened to Olive in the old stone house, but none as scary as starting junior high.

Grades 4-6. --Ilene Cooper</p><h2>Proof Positive: A Joe Gunther Novel (Joe Gunther Series)</h2><p><p>Ben Kendall was a troubled man. Coming back from Vietnam with PTSD and scars that no one else could see, he hid away from the world, filling his house with an ever-increasing amount of stuff, until finally, the piles collapsed and he was found dead, crushed beneath his own belongings. But what at first glance looks to be a tragic accidental death of a hoarder, may be something much more&#x2015;and much deadlier. Ben's cousin, medical examiner Beverly Hillstrom, unsettled by the circumstances of his death, alerts Joe Gunther and his Vermont Bureau of Investigation team. </p><p>Ben, it seems, brought back something else from Vietnam than personal demons&#x2015;he also brought back combat photos and negatives that someone else wants desperately to keep from the public eye. When Beverly's daughter Rachel made her cousin Ben&#x2015;and his photos&#x2015;the subject of her college art project, some of those photos appeared on the walls of a local art gallery. This in turn resulted in the appearance of a two man hit squad, searching for some other missing negatives. With Joe Gunther and his squad trailing behind the grisly research results of the hit team, and the deadly killers closing in on Rachel, Gunther has little time to find and protect Rachel before she ends up in the same grisly state as her cousin before her. Archer Mayor's <i>Proof Positive</i> is another enthralling installment in the Joe Gunther Series.</p></p><p><p>ARCHER MAYOR, in addition to writing the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Joe Gunther series, is an investigator for the sheriff's department, the state medical examiner, and has twenty-five years of experience as a firefighter/EMT. He lives near Brattleboro, Vermont.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It was the time of year when New England wobbles between fall and winter, as prone to Indian summer as to sudden, short-lived snowstorms.</p> <p>It wasn&#x2019;t snowing tonight, but it was cold, and Jason Newville was regretting that he&#x2019;d only worn a sweatshirt. Nerves played a part. Unlike some, he tended to cool down when he was on a job, instead of working up an adrenaline sweat. But as with most things taken for granted, he hadn&#x2019;t considered it when he set out, and was paying the price now.</p> <p>It wasn&#x2019;t unbearable. He was born to this weather, and in line with southeastern Vermont&#x2019;s being mockingly labeled &#x201c;the banana belt,&#x201d; it did run warmer here than in the rest of the state. He&#x2019;d survive. Besides, he had things to keep him occupied, like the whereabouts of the crazy old man who lived here.</p> <p>Jason stepped out from behind a large maple at the edge of the darkened property and studied the layout by the light of a full moon. This wasn&#x2019;t his first visit. He&#x2019;d been here twice before over the past week. There&#x2019;d never been a change. The house remained still and as black as a tomb. Just as it was tonight.</p> <p>But instead of lending him confidence, the silence only bred foreboding.</p> <p>Jason had been burglarizing homes for three years, time enough to have developed a balance between caution and foolhardiness. He had an instinct about most places&#x2014;an inner radar, as he saw it&#x2014;that had helped to keep him out of jail, so far.</p> <p>But that radar wasn&#x2019;t working here. He was as keyed up as during the first time he&#x2019;d crept from the woods that girdled the house.</p> <p>It was a rambling spread, once entirely agricultural, with barns, sheds, paddocks, and a centrally located family house. With time, most of the fields had been abandoned or sold off, and each structure at the farm&#x2019;s core&#x2014;depending on its original sturdiness&#x2014;had fallen into disrepair, or to the brink of collapse. The one sign of expansion&#x2014;at once attractive and daunting to Jason&#x2014;was the steadily accumulating piles of looming, jagged scrap. Depending on their nature and/or size, they bulged outward from every orifice of every building, or seemed to erupt from the earth as semi-mountainous heaps of mechanical debris.</p> <p>Balers, tractors, combines, tedders, conveyor belts, pickup trucks, generators, and more&#x2014;ghostly, hulking, rusty, and inoperable monsters teetered drunkenly under the bright moon like otherworldly space junk gleaned from the night sky in the sweeping gesture of an invisible hand. It was an entangled collection of such enormity that it staggered the imagination, and&#x2014;its scope magnified by the steely-sharp lunar lighting&#x2014;ignited in Jason&#x2019;s chest an instinctive fear about what or who, besides him, might also be silently lurking among the riot of sharp-edged shadows.</p> <p>He knew of the crazy guy who lived here&#x2014;Ben Kendall. A loner, an eccentric, a hoarder of vast appetite. He was a local fixture, keeping to himself but roaming constantly around the neighborhood, his ramshackle open-bed truck swaying under a precarious tower of mostly metal debris. Hand-lettered wooden panels along both sides of the truck advertised KENDALL&#x2019;S SCRAP &amp; RECYCLING, although everyone suspected that the &#x201c;recycling&#x201d; remained mostly in Ben&#x2019;s mind. No one that Jason knew had ever seen that truck leave Ben&#x2019;s property other than empty.</p> <p>Jason stepped from the trees, not running ducked over as he had the first time, but with trepidation nevertheless, seized by the place&#x2019;s malevolent quality.</p> <p>As often occurred in the mythos surrounding hoarders, neighborhood rumors of treasure residing in the heart of Ben&#x2019;s possessions had curled like smoke tendrils. There was no evidence of it. Ben displayed no proof of wealth anywhere. But word had reached Jason&#x2019;s ears a month earlier, and prompted his initial reconnaissance a few days ago.</p> <p>He hadn&#x2019;t stayed long that time, mostly touring the property&#x2019;s perimeters, like a wolf rounding the edges of a sheep pen. As with tonight, there&#x2019;d been no movement or sound. He&#x2019;d tried peering through windows, to find every view blocked, and had opened the occasional outbuilding door, to meet a wall of objects standing against him. But no dogs had barked, no lights had come on, and Jason had begun thinking of the place as an unheard-of possibility: a bottomless well to revisit time and again.</p> <p>His second foray had therefore been bolder. He&#x2019;d driven here in a borrowed vehicle, bringing two duffel bags. As before, he&#x2019;d met no resistance or opposition, but he&#x2019;d been infected by a cloaking eeriness, and at the last minute, opted to stay outside. He&#x2019;d foraged among the precariously balanced pyramids for the odd piece of salvage that he could extract with minimal noise, and left largely empty-handed and stymied.</p> <p>Because that was the irony, even to him: While all this was far from any road or keen-eared neighbor, and had never shown signs of life during his visits, Jason couldn&#x2019;t shake the feeling that he was being watched. Like a hypersensitive rodent recognizing the trap while mesmerized by its contents, Jason kept tentatively reaching out, convincing himself that his desire would eventually overpower his dread.</p> <p>Tonight, he&#x2019;d told himself, he was going inside.</p> <p>Because those rumors had to be true. How else could Ben survive, unless he had a ready supply of money? This was a big property, even if in decay. For Jason, whose past homes had been trailers, flophouses, and other people&#x2019;s couches, Ben&#x2019;s spread was an estate. And estates had to be paid for.</p> <p>Jason approached the farmhouse&#x2019;s front door, set back under a sagging porch roof and guarded by sentries of cordwood, lawn furniture, rusting grills, bicycles, car fenders, and bald tires. He placed a foot carefully on the first stair tread, and pressed down, as he might have in testing the buoyancy of a floating dock. Surprisingly, it remained solid, not emitting the merest creak, as if the wood had been compressed beyond complaint by time and neglect.</p> <p>He continued, his hands out unconsciously, atop an invisible tightrope. To either side, the dark hedgerows of Ben&#x2019;s belongings closed around him as he neared the door, silent and still.</p> <p>He placed one hand on the knob and used the other to extract a flashlight from his pocket, suddenly unsure whether he should use it now, or wait until he&#x2019;d opened the door. Yielding to fear, he hit the switch before pulling the knob.</p> <p>The door opened reluctantly, rubbing against the inner floorboards, its hinges complaining without conviction. The inside air spilled out, wrapping him in a fog&#x2014;warm, fetid, cloying, almost alive. He felt the entire house had just released a deep, internal sigh.</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, God,&#x201d; he barely whispered, knowing that the slightest unexpected sound or motion now would be enough to send him flying.</p> <p>But, as always in his experience here, there was only the silence accompanying the absence of life, or the holding of one&#x2019;s breath.</p> <p>Timidly, he played his light along the floor ahead, and off to both sides, taking in not a room, as he&#x2019;d expected, but the narrow confines of a tunnel formed of densely packed newspapers, magazines, and boxes, reaching up to the ceiling.</p> <p>Scowling, his breathing shallow and rapid, Jason eased by the doorway and entered the rough-walled shaft, his flashlight setting off an endless shifting of shadows. The thick air around him closed in.</p> <p>Fifteen feet along, he came to a widening, where the clutter lowered enough to allow him to see farther afield. He was standing in a four-foot-deep foxhole, peering out over an undulating landscape of newspapers, files, furniture, catalogs, and paper products. The beam in his hand brought to mind a battlefield searchlight, crisscrossing a no-man&#x2019;s-land in search of movement. In the distance, the tops of doorways indicated paths to adjoining rooms, with overhead clearances of a couple of feet. He had no notion of what the original purpose might have been of the room he was occupying.</p> <p>Sweating now, light-headed in the rank atmosphere, Jason wiped his forehead with the back of his sleeve, wondering what to do, where to start. Surrounded by more than the plenty he&#x2019;d dreamed of, he was stuck.</p> <p>Reluctantly, he climbed from the trench and crawled onto the surrounding rubbish, unsure of what rotting object he might encounter by chance, or even if the unstable surface might suddenly give way and swallow him whole. Fueling his concern, the commingled layers beneath kept slipping as he moved.</p> <p>He headed for the nearest crawl-space doorway, feeling increasingly trapped and hopeless, telling himself that not every room was the same as this one, and that he was bound to discover some order that made sense.</p> <p>&#x201c;I just want to steal something,&#x201d; he murmured as he went, not reflecting on the absurdity of either the statement or his predicament.</p> <p>In fact, there was a change after he slithered under his chosen door header. From his perch there, he found the room beyond filled more with mechanical objects than with paper. There were appliances and large woodworking equipment intermixed with books, operator manuals, and piles of broken or rusty hand tools. Depending on the spot, he could even see the floor.</p> <p>Still, he hesitated atop the doorway&#x2019;s steep slope, surveying the chaos ahead with growing frustration. Again, he could see nothing of value, and too much of everything. His head was pounding, and he was getting angry.</p> <p>Hungry for any success, he finally swung around and slid down the embankment like a kid on a toboggan, skittering paper to both sides and arresting his descent by jamming his boots against a three-legged drill press.</p> <p>That was the end of all stealth. The drill slowly toppled, smashing into its metallic neighbor and throwing dozens of items into the air.</p> <p>Jason covered his head against the shower of hardware, throwing out a hand for balance. As he&#x2019;d been dreading from the start, his fingers closed on something cold, soft, and damp. He screamed in horror, dropping his flashlight in the process.</p> <p>Scurrying backwards, rubbing his palm obsessively against his pants, he retrieved the rolling light and aimed it at the offending object.</p> <p>Caught in the bright halo, peering from under the avalanche like a discarded animal carcass, was a partially decayed human face.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Archer Mayor</p></p><h2>Known to Evil (Leonid McGill, Book 2)</h2><p><b> The Walter Mosley and his new hero, Leonid McGill, are back in the new <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling mystery series that's already being hailed as a classic of contemporary noir. </b><br><br> Leonid McGill&#x2014;the protagonist introduced in <i>The Long Fall</i>, the book that returned Walter Mosley to bestseller lists nationwide&#x2014;is still fighting to stick to his reformed ways while the world around him pulls him in every other direction.

Now it held Katrina&#x2019;s cherished Blue Danube china collection, which she inherited from her favorite aunt, Bergit. On top of the chest was an old quart pickle jar&#x2014; the makeshift vase for an arrangement of tiny wildflowers of every color from scarlet to cornflower blue to white. </p> <p>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re frowning,&#x201d; my beautiful Scandinavian wife said. &#x201c;What were you thinking about?&#x201d; </p> <p>I looked up from the filet mignon and Gorgonzola blue cheese salad to gaze at the flowers. My thoughts were not the kind of dinner conversation one had with one&#x2019;s wife and family. </p> <p><i>I have a boyfriend now,</i> Aura Ullman had told me that morning. <i>I wanted to tell you. I didn&#x2019;t want to feel like I&#x2019;m hiding anything from you. </i></p> <p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you get those flowers, Mom?&#x201d; Shelly asked. </p> <p><i>His name is George, </i>Aura told me, the sad empathy in the words making its way to her face. </p> <p>I had no reason to be jealous. Aura and I had been lovers over the eight months Katrina abandoned me for the investment banker Andre Zool. I loved Aura but gave her up because when Katrina came back, after Andre was indicted for fraud, I felt that she, Katrina, was my sentence for the wrong I had done in a long life of crime. </p> <p>&#x201c;I saw them at the deli and thought they might brighten up our dinner,&#x201d; Katrina told her daughter. </p> <p>Shelly had been trying to forgive her mother for leaving me. She was a sophomore at CCNY and another man&#x2019;s daughter, though she didn&#x2019;t know it. Two of my children were fathered out of wedlock; only the eldest, sour and taciturn Dimitri, who always sat as far away from me as possible, was of my blood. </p> <p><i>Do you love him? </i>I hadn&#x2019;t meant to ask Aura that. I didn&#x2019;t want to know the answer or to show vulnerability. </p> <p><i>He&#x2019;s very good company . . . and I get lonely. </i></p> <p>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; Katrina asked. </p> <p>Something about those flowers and the echo of Aura&#x2019;s voice in my mind made me want to curse, or maybe to slam my fist down on the plate. </p> <p>&#x201c;Hey, everybody,&#x201d; Twill said. He was standing in the doorway to the dining room; dark and slender, handsome and flawless except for a small crescent scar on his chin. </p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re late,&#x201d; Katrina scolded my favorite. </p> <p>&#x201c;You know it, Moms,&#x201d; the seventeen- year- old man replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m lucky to get home at all with everything I got to do. My PO got me workin&#x2019; this after- school job at the supermarket. Says it&#x2019;ll keep me outta trouble.&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not a parole officer. He&#x2019;s a juvenile offender social worker,&#x201d; I said. </p> <p>Just seeing Twill brought levity into the room. </p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a he,&#x201d; Twill said as he slid into the chair next to me. </p> <p>&#x201c;Ms. Melinda Tarris says that she wants me workin&#x2019; three afternoons a week.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And she&#x2019;s right, too,&#x201d; I added. &#x201c;You need something to occupy your mind and keep you out of trouble.&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not people like me that get in trouble, Pops,&#x201d; Twill sang. &#x201c;I talk so much and know so many people that I can&#x2019;t get away with nuthin&#x2019; somebody don&#x2019;t see it. It&#x2019;s the quiet ones that get in the most trouble. Ain&#x2019;t that right, Bulldog?&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you be quiet sometimes?&#x201d; dour Dimitri said. </p> <p>Twill&#x2019;s pet name for his older brother was an apt one. Like me Dimitri was short and big- boned, powerful even though he rarely exercised. His skin was not quite as dark brown as mine but you could see me in every part of him. I wondered why he was so angry at his brother&#x2019;s chiding. Even though Dimitri never liked me much he loved his siblings. And he had a special bond with Twill, who was so outgoing all he had to do was sit down in a room for five minutes and a party was likely to break out. </p> <p>&#x201c;Leonid.&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, Katrina?&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; </p> <p>Even though we&#x2019;d drifted apart like the continents had&#x2014; long ago&#x2014; Katrina could still read my moods. We had a kind of subterranean connection that allowed my wife to see, at least partly, into my state of mind. It wasn&#x2019;t just Aura&#x2019;s decision to move on that bothered me. It was my life at that table, Dimitri&#x2019;s uncharacteristic anger at his brother, and even those delicate flowers sitting where I had never seen a bouquet before. </p> <p>There was a feeling at the back of my mind, something that was burgeoning into consciousness like a vibrating moth pressing out from its cocoon. </p> <p>The phone rang and Katrina started. When I looked into her gray- blue eyes some kind of wordless knowledge seemed to pass between us.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get it,&#x201d; Shelly shouted. She hurried from the room into the hall, where the cordless unit sat on its ledge. </p> <p>Katrina smiled at me. Even this made me wonder. She&#x2019;d been back home for nearly a year. In that time her smile had been tentative, contrite. She wanted me to know that she was there for the long run, that she was sorry for her transgressions and wanted to make our life together work. But that evening her smile was confident. Even the way she sat was regal and self- assured. </p> <p>&#x201c;Dad, it&#x2019;s for you.&#x201d;</p> <p>Standing up from my chair and moving into the hallway, I felt as if I were displaced, another man, or maybe the same man in a similar but vastly different world: the working- poor lottery winner who suddenly one day realizes that riches have turned his blood to vinegar. </p> <p>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; I said into the receiver. </p> <p>I was expecting an acquaintance or maybe a credit- card company asking about a suspect charge. No one who I did business with had my home number. The kind of business I was in couldn&#x2019;t be addressed by an innocent. </p> <p>&#x201c;Leonid,&#x201d; a man&#x2019;s voice said, &#x201c;this is Sam Strange.&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;Why are you calling me at my home?&#x201d; I asked, because though Strange was the legman for Alphonse Rinaldo, one of the secret pillars of New York&#x2019;s political and economic systems, I couldn&#x2019;t allow even him to infringe on my domestic life, such as it was. </p> <p>&#x201c;The Big Man called and said it was an emergency,&#x201d; Strange said. </p> <p>Sam worked for the seemingly self- appointed Special Assistant to the City of New York. I say seemingly, because even though Alphonse Rinaldo was definitely attached to City Hall, no one knew his job description or the extent of his power. </p> <p>I had done a few questionable jobs for the man before I decided to go straight. And while I was no longer engaging in criminal activities I couldn&#x2019;t afford to turn him down without a hearing. </p> <p>&#x201c;What is it you want?&#x201d; I asked. </p> <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a young woman named Tara Lear that he wants you to make contact with.&#x201d; </p> <p>Sam rarely, if ever, spoke Rinaldo&#x2019;s name. He had an internal censor like those of old- time printers who replaced &#x201c;God&#x201d; with &#x201c; G- d&#x201d; in books. </p> <p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;He just wants you to speak to her and to make sure everything&#x2019;s all right. He told me to tell you that he would consider this a great favor.&#x201d; </p> <p>Being able to do a favor for Special Assistant Rinaldo was like winning six lotteries rolled into one. My blood might turn into high- octane rocket fuel if I wasn&#x2019;t careful. </p> <p>Not for the first time I wondered if I would ever get out from under my iniquitous past. </p> <p>&#x201c;Leonid,&#x201d; Sam Strange said. </p> <p>&#x201c;When am I supposed to find this young woman?&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;Now . . . tonight. And you don&#x2019;t have to find her, I can tell you exactly where she is.&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;If you know where she is why don&#x2019;t you just tell him and he can go talk to her himself?&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;This is the way he wants it.&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you go?&#x201d; I asked. </p> <p>&#x201c;He wants you, Leonid.&#x201d; </p> <p>I heard Twill say something in the dining room but couldn&#x2019;t make out the words. His mother and Shelly laughed. </p> <p>&#x201c;Leonid,&#x201d; Sam Strange said again. </p> <p>&#x201c;Right now?&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;Immediately.&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;You know I&#x2019;m trying to be aboveboard nowadays, Sam.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s just asking you to go and speak to this Lear woman. To make sure that she&#x2019;s all right. There&#x2019;s nothing illegal about that.&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;m ...</p></p><h2>The Heat Death of the Universe and Other Stories</h2><p>Pamela Zoline&#39;s titular &#34;Heat Death&#34; from this collection is often correctly billed as the best short story of the British New Wave movement of the late 60s/early 70s. Postmodern in style, feminist in message, and providing a fascinating blend of hard and soft sf, it deserves to be read more. But don&#39;t buy this collection for just &#34;Heat Death&#34; - there are other gems here as well. Although not sf, &#34;The Holland of the Mind&#34; is another pomo masterpiece; &#34;Sheep&#34; is brilliant as well; in fact all of the stories have something to offer. If you like stylistically challenging reading that crosses genre boundaries, this is the collection for you. If only Zoline wrote more!</p><p>Thomas M. Disch is the author of such classic works of science fiction as &#34;Camp Concentration, 334, The Brave Little Toaster, &#34; and &#34;On Wings of Song, &#34; all of which are cited in David Pringle&#39;s &#34;Science Fiction: 100 Best Novels.&#34; His criticism has appeared in the country&#39;s leading magazines and newspapers. His book &#34;The Castle of Indolence&#34; was a nominee for the National Book Critic Circle&#39;s Award in Criticism.SF readers were delighted by the 1967 publication of "The Heat Death of the Universe" in the British magazine New Worlds, but Zoline's appeal extends beyond that genre. In a collage style, "Heat Death" juxtaposes the principle of entropy and the life of a California housewife, which offers one small, moving illustration. Here, according to Nabokov's prescription, Zoline's cerebral, painterly prose combines the passion of the scientist with the precision of the poet. If nothing else in this first collection matches the title story's concision, emotional electricity or absurdist humor, Zoline's distinctive voice and postmodernist undercutting of cliche and formula remain intact throughout. A photographer's mental breakdown in "The Holland of the Mind" becomes a sensory overload of Dutch sights and sweets, of Rembrandt and Vermeer, of a new language that seems "a kind of clown English." The novella "Sheep" is a dotty encyclopedist's anthology by association of ideasof lullabies, sleep, dreams, counting sheep, sheepherders and cattlemen, shepherds and the pastoral as a literary genre, etc. This overdue collection is to be savored while awaiting Zoline's first novel, also long anticipated. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Five Hundred Years of Book Design</h2><p>What decisions lie behind the way a book is designed? How are readers of books helped or hindered by the choices that a designer, publisher, or printer has made in presenting an author's text to its intended audience? Are there any lessons we can learn from a study of the books that have been produced in previous centuries?<br>In this illustrated volume, Alan Bartram, a distinguished book designer and typographer, answers many of these questions and provides his personal view of some of the successes and failures of his predecessors. He looks with fresh eyes at a varied range of books published in western Europe and America in the last half-millennium, concerning himself in particular with readability, function, and clarification of meaning. He also discusses how different elements of text, decoration, and illustration were combined in the layout of the printed page, and he comments on whether the resultant design is successful.<br>Concisely written and handsomely produced, this visual history of book design and production is intended for a wide audience - students of graphic design and the history of the book, bibliophiles, collectors, and all who are interested in the visual communication of ideas.</p><p>Alan Bartram is a book designer and the author of many graphic design titles, including Typefaces for Books (with James Sutton), Making Books: Design in British Publishing Since 1945, and Creating the Printed Page.In 500 Years of Book Design, British book designer Alan Bartram (Typefaces for Books) parses the rectos and versos of pages famous (the Kelmscott Chaucer) and less so (Benjamin Franklin's edition of Cicero's Cato Major), showing how and why different typesetting decisions are made. And he does so by example this beautifully laid-out book puts commentary on the top quarter of each page, with the remainder being devoted to wonderful reproductions of the classic designs in question. More a set of self-described "personal observations" than systematic study, this book will entice anyone who reads for more than gist. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Dry Bones in the Valley: A Novel (The Henry Farrell Series, 1)</h2><p><p><strong>Winner of the 2015 <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Book Prize<br><br> When an elderly recluse discovers a corpse on his land, Officer Henry Farrell follows the investigation to strange places in the countryside, and into the depths of his own frayed soul.</strong></p> In Wild Thyme, Pennsylvania, secrets and feuds go back generations. The lone policeman in a small township on the sparse northern border, Henry Farrell expected to spend his mornings hunting and fishing, his evenings playing old-time music. Instead, he has watched the steady encroachment of gas drilling bring new wealth and erode neighborly trust. The drug trade is pushing heroin into the territory. There are outlaws cooking meth in the woods, guys Henry grew up with. When a stranger turns up dead, Henry&#x2019;s search for the killer will open old wounds, dredge up ancient crimes, and exact a deadly price. <p>With vivid characters and flawless pacing, Tom Bouman immerses readers in rural northeastern Pennsylvania, a region in the grip of change. In these derelict woods full of whitetail deer and history, the hunt is on.</p></p><p>Tom Bouman&#x2019;s first book, Dry Bones in the Valley, won the Edgar Award for Best First Novel and a Los Angeles Times Book Prize. He lives in Pennsylvania.&#x201c;A tough, edgy thriller that asks hard questions about the destruction of our environment, our local communities, and our families. Readers of smart literary thrillers are going to love this novel. I wish like hell that my name were on the cover.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Wiley Cash, <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author of <em>A Land More Kind Than Home</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Raymond Chandler said that Hammett took murder away from the manor houses and gave it back to the people who actually commit it. Tom Bouman continues that tradition. Bouman's story is deceptively simple, layered with history, bearing the promise of lightness, of redemption.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>James Sallis, author of <em>Drive</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Tom Bouman is a remarkable new voice in contemporary fiction. <em>Dry Bones in the Valley</em> is a tightly crafted piece of rural noir that seems pulled from the earth itself, a profound look at the dark corners of rural America. Readers of Daniel Woodrell and Donald Ray Pollock will find much to love.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Steve Weddle, author of <em>Country Hardball</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;It's a mystery, yes, but it's also a love story between a man and the land and people he knows like the back of his hand. <em>Dry Bones in the Valley</em> is a gorgeous, lived-in novel, and Bouman's turns of phrase are chest-clutching in their beauty.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Hannah Pittard, author of <em>The Fates Will Find Their Way</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;So smooth it's as if it was written on spring water. Shadowy, swift, impossible to put down. I was enraptured. Any justice and this writer will soon be a major star.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Joe R. Lansdale, author of <i>Deadman&#x2019;s Road</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Officer Henry Farrell is a shy man, but in his own ways just as ornery and tough as the cast of rugged characters who inhabit his Pennsylvania woods, where the mysteries are as old as love and grief.

Tom Bouman&#x2019;s debut novel is one you won&#x2019;t want to miss.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ed Falco, author of <i>The Family Corleone</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[An] outstanding debut... Henry&#x2019;s growth from a grief-stricken widower to a lawman with an inner resolve fuels the brisk plot, as does an evocative look at a changing landscape.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly, Starred review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Bouman&#x2019;s debut shows rural noir at its finest: a poetically written mystery about a man struggling with his inner demons and an area of great natural beauty few had heard of before the natural gas boom.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews, Starred Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Grit-lit meets wry suspense, along with a keen rendering of place and politics.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>New York Magazine (Six Books to Read this Summer)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Some stories are so sad, you want them to have the comfort of a gentle storytelling voice.

The book does something very important - it makes you impatient to see or re-read the plays at once' Hilary Mantel</b></p><p>A genius and prophet whose timeless works encapsulate the human condition like no others. A writer who surpassed his contemporaries in vision, originality and literary mastery. Who wrote like an angel, putting it all so much better than anyone else.</p><p>Is this Shakespeare? Well, sort of.</p><p>But it doesn't really tell us the whole truth. So much of what we say about Shakespeare is either not true, or just not relevant, deflecting us from investigating the challenges of his inconsistencies and flaws. This electrifying new book thrives on revealing, not resolving, the ambiguities of Shakespeare's plays and their changing topicality. It introduces an intellectually, theatrically and ethically exciting writer who engages with intersectionality as much as with Ovid, with economics as much as poetry: who writes in strikingly modern ways about individual agency, privacy, politics, celebrity and sex. It takes us into a world of politicking and copy-catting, as we watch him emulating the blockbusters of Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Kyd, the Spielberg and Tarantino of their day; flirting with and skirting round the cut-throat issues of succession politics, religious upheaval and technological change. The Shakespeare in this book poses awkward questions rather than offering bland answers, always implicating us in working out what it might mean.</p><p><i>This</i> is Shakespeare. And he needs your attention.</p></p><p></p><h2>Big-Eyed Afraid</h2><p>&#34;In Big-Eyed Afraid, a first book of genuine originality, Erica Dawson turns the mirror held up to nature on herself. Both humorous and heart-wrenching, Dawson balances formal adroitness with a 21st-century colloquial idiom modulating between demotic and mandarin registers, a voice all her own. Employing numerous forms, including the rondeau, ballade, rhyme royal and her own adaptation of the In Memoriam stanza, Dawson elevates the self only to see it combust into pieces of broken character, an arch of introspection signalled by the book&#39;s opening and ending series of nickname poems, including &#34;Nappyhead,&#34; &#34;Mommy Dearest,&#34; and &#34;DrugFace,&#34; where contradictions of personal, cultural, and intellectual identities are exposed. In between, Dawson completes the case history, calling on everyone from Freud and Puccini to Rita Hayworth and James Brown while craftily moving between rhyme&#39;s mellifluous voice and that of a frighteningly self-effacing honesty: &#34;...search high for your halo and penance / And a murder of crows and your birthday&#39;s sentence.&#34; Yet for every stanza spent in Dawson&#39;s mind, each page of Big-Eyed Afraid opens up to face and find shade from reality&#39;s &#34;blue leaded sun burning its shine too strong.&#34;</p><p>"Erica Dawson is the most exciting younger poet I've seen in years. What drive and verve! Even in lines under tight control, she can sound reckless. Her dazzling wit informs poem after poem, making each seem like a stiff drink with a dash of bitters. Big-Eyed Afraid is a sensational debut. I can't recall finding this much energy between two covers since Ariel."<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X. J. Kennedy, poet, editor of Literature: An Introduction to Fiction, Poetry, Drama, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;Writing <br><br> "Polished but unvarnished, exquisitely alive, the poems in Big-Eyed Afraid are utterly electrifying. Erica Dawson's is a name to remember, and these are poems you won't forget."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Claire Messud, author of The Woman Upstairs <br><br> "Big-Eyed Afraid is a fast-paced, breathlessly witty and illuminating riff on the multiple effects of race, sex, biology and social pressure on who we are and how we see ourselves. Dawson's dazzling rhymes, her perfect pitch for an array of idioms ranging from the smutty to the sacred, and her extraordinary combination of metrical control and jazz-like syntactical elaboration make her work feel at one and the same time chiseled and improvised, traditional and utterly distinct. Brilliantly alert to multiple influences yet irreducibly tied to this particular poet at this particular moment in our collective history, Big-Eyed Afraid is one of the most compelling and entertaining books of poetry I've read in I don't know how long." <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan Shapiro, author of Night of the RepublicErica Dawson is the author of two collections of poetry: <em>The Small Blades Hurt</em> (Measure Press, 2014) and BIG-EYED AFRAID (Waywiser, 2007). Her poems have appeared in <em>Best American Poetry, Barrow Street, Birmingham Poetry Review, Harvard Review, Literary Imagination, Virginia Quarterly Review</em> and numerous other journals and anthologies. Her reviews and criticism have appeared in <em>Florida Review, At Length Magazine</em> and other publications. Very active in Tampa's art community, she serves as poetry editor for the <em>Tampa Review.</em></p><h2>Language, Thought and Reality: Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf</h2><p><p>The pioneering linguist Benjamin Whorf (1897--1941) grasped the relationship between human language and human thinking: how language can shape our innermost thoughts. His basic thesis is that our perception of the world and our ways of thinking about it are deeply influenced by the structure of the languages we speak. The writings collected in this volume include important papers on the Maya, Hopi, and Shawnee languages as well as more general reflections on language and meaning.</p></p><p>Benjamin Lee Whorf, originally trained as a chemical engineer, began his work in linguistics in the 1920s and became well known for his studies of the Hopi language. He studied with the famous linguist Edward Sapir at Yale University, formulating with him the Sapir--Whorf Hypothesis of linguistic relativity.</p><h2>The Adventurous Chef: Alexis Soyer</h2><p>In 1837, when Alexis Soyer was just twenty-five years old, he became head chef at the exclusive Reform Club in London on the condition that he be allowed to participate in the design of the kitchen. The result was a showplace filled with Soyer's clever inventions, such as the drainer and the multi-egg poacher, and it became the most talked about kitchen in all of Europe. Soyer quickly established himself as a star, but for all his flamboyance he was practical and large-hearted, cooking for the starving populace as well as the aristocracy, opening soup kitchens during the Irish potato famine, and teaching the army how to feed itself in the Crimean War. <br><br>Filled with biographical detail and lively illustrations, <i>The Adventurous Chef</i> tells the story of a remarkable man who was determined to revolutionize the culinary world and who remains one of the greatest cooks of the nineteenth century.</p><p>Ann Arnold has illustrated several books for children. She lives in Berkeley, California.Gr. 3-6. In this picture book for older children Arnold uses whimsical drawings and a lively text to introduce Alexis Soyer, one of the most accomplished and celebrated cooks in nineteenth-century Europe. She follows the chef's fascinating career, from his apprenticeship to his cooking for the aristocracy to his move to London's upper-crust Reform Club, where his cuisine and innovative kitchen designs brought him world renown. Arnold also includes insight into Soyer's wildly creative activities as a social reformer: he trained "charitable women" how to cook soup for the poor, wrote socially conscious cookbooks, created portable soup kitchens for the Irish during the potato famine, and completely revolutionized the way food was prepared for hospitals and the military (he cooked for the troops during the Crimean War). Unfortunately, there are neither source notes nor an author's note to support the well-shaped, animated text, which is filled with dialogue. But Arnold's clean-lined, watercolor-and-pen illustrations, several per page, sparkle with lavishly depicted banquets, close-ups of Soyer's inventions (including a cross-section of the elaborate Reform Club kitchen), and portraits of the chef that, like the narrative, give a sense of Soyer's complexity--his talent, energy, flamboyance, and heart. A unique, delightful offering that will work well with Alice Waters' <i>Fanny at Chez Panisse </i>(1993), which Arnold illustrated. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The second installment of Ness&#39;s trilogy finds 13-year-old New World colonist Todd Hewitt and his friend, settler Viola Eade, at the mercy of self-proclaimed and manipulative President Prentiss. Together they must fight for their freedom and the preservation of the New World, but to do this, they need to find each other and then attempt to contact Viola&#39;s fellow settlers. Nick Podehl gives a pitch-perfect portrayal of the confused and fierce Todd; Angela Dawe portrays the frightened but determined Viola. Together, their performances create a stellar listening experience. K.O.

This is an emotionally fraught and at some times terrifying story about two sisters and the strength that binds them.Winner of a Nielsen Gold Award for exceptional sales.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, June 2011</strong>: When the body of Beatrice&#x2019;s beloved younger sister, Tess, is discovered in an abandoned building in Hyde Park and ruled a suicide, Beatrice knows the police have made a mistake. She&#x2019;s certain her sister was murdered. Determined to uncover the truth, Beatrice impulsively begins to hunt for clues on her own. So begins Rosamund Lupton&#x2019;s stunning debut, <em>Sister</em>, at once an engrossing thriller and a powerful meditation on the bonds of family. Writing her story as a letter to Tess, Beatrice gradually connects the strange, varied occurrences leading up to Tess&#x2019;s death--Tess&#x2019;s pregnancy; a trial drug from a pharmaceutical company; a man who may or may not have been a figment of Tess&#x2019;s imagination. Beatrice&#x2019;s former life falls apart as her search veers toward obsession, and she realizes she might pay a terrible price for the truth. An adrenaline-filled psychological thriller, <em>Sister</em>&#x2019;s emotional impact comes from Lupton&#x2019;s heartrending portrait of the love between Beatrice and Tess. <em>--Lynette Mong</em> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: A Q&amp;A with Rosamund Lupton</strong> <br> <br> We had the opportunity to chat with bestselling author Rosamund Lupton about her debut novel (and one of our Best Books of June 2011), <em>Sister</em>, via e-mail. Read on to see what Rosamund had to say about London, sisterhood, her next novel, and more: <br><br><strong>Amazon.com</strong><strong>:</strong> Before writing <em>Sister</em>, you worked for many years as a screenwriter. How does the process of writing a novel differ from writing for television? <p></p> <p><strong>Rosamund Lupton:</strong> When I was writing screenplays I was just one part of a creative process, it would take the talents of many other people to bring the screenplay to life. With a novel, you know what you type is the finished thing--there&#x2019;s just me--and that feels both daunting and liberating. As a screenwriter I was often ticked off for "directing from the page" or "writing a novel not a script!" Now, I love being able to use as many words as I like to tell the story--a hundred thousand in the case of <em>Sister</em>--and being able to write the interior life of a character as well as their surface interactions.</p> <p><strong>Amazon.com</strong><strong>:</strong> I love the way London almost becomes a character unto itself in this story. The city seems to mimic Beatrice&#x2019;s emotional state while she searches for clues about Tess&#x2019;s death. Why did you select London as the setting? Did you spend time exploring the places Beatrice visits?</p> <p><strong>Rosamund Lupton:</strong> I chose London as I know it so well, I&#x2019;ve lived here for many years, and because, as you say, it possesses a chameleon quality to show a state of mind. For example, Hyde Park in the depth of winter is covered in snow and silent, with leafless trees and is so different from a bright Spring day when the trees and grass are green and there&#x2019;s children paddling in the fountain. I&#x2019;m not surprised its been used so often for films; it has a cinematic quality and at the beginning of the book it&#x2019;s like a black and white film set to me. I already knew all the places Beatrice visits as they are close to where I lived for many years, or worked, so the city is like an old friend.</p> <p><strong>Amazon.com</strong><strong>:</strong> <em>Sister</em> is written as a letter from Beatrice to Tess. Why did you choose to structure the novel this way?</p> <p><strong>Rosamund Lupton:</strong> At one point, Beatrice says to Tess, "it&#x2019;s a one way conversation, but one I could only have with you." I felt that writing it this way continually demonstrates their intimacy. Also, as a former scriptwriter, I found it easier to tell the story as one character speaking to another; as if it&#x2019;s one half of a dialogue.</p> <p><strong>Amazon.com</strong><strong>:</strong> Did your relationship with your own sister impact how you crafted the relationship between Beatrice and Tess?</p> <p><strong>Rosamund Lupton:</strong> I know as an older sister how protective and responsible I&#x2019;ve always felt towards my sister and I posed the question, what would you do if your sister went missing? I knew that Beatrice in the book would drop everything and get the first flight to find Tess--as I think almost any sister would do. Although Beatrice and Tess are very different from my sister and myself, the emotional truth of their relationship is one I know well. Like my sister and I, the closeness between them is made up of a million tiny details rather than simply the "big things." Some small details are drawn directly from my own life. For example, my sister and I wrote to each other at boarding school, and used jigsaw letters and ones with invisible ink.</p> <p><strong>Amazon.com</strong><strong>:</strong> Can you tell us anything about your next novel?</p> <p><strong>Rosamund Lupton:</strong> It begins with a mother running into a burning school to rescue her teenage daughter. The book continues to be about how far a woman will go to protect her family. It&#x2019;s ultimately about love not recognizing any boundaries.</p> <p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> <em>Sister</em> is bound to be on a lot of summer reading lists. What are you looking forward to reading this summer?</p> <p><strong>Rosamund Lupton:</strong> I have a big pile of books that are looking so enticing, I can&#x2019;t wait to have time to read them! At the top are Jennifer Egan&#x2019;s <em>A Visit from the Goon Squad</em> and Sarah Winman&#x2019;s <em>When God Was a Rabbit</em>.</p>For years Rosamund Lupton has been a script writer for the BBC.

You got off easy! In this delightful anthology, some of the world&#39;s best travel writers, novelists and journalists -- Eric Hansen, Pico Iyer, Barbara Kingsolver, and 48 others -- offer up the agonies of their worst trips. With an introduction by Mary Morris and a final rebuttal by Jan Morris.While some of these essays transcend the limited range of their focus, the majority have the shallow immediacy of anecdotes told around a bar. There are endless accounts of nightmarish trips by boat, car and bus (too many people, lots of bad smells) and, more banal, airplane; horrifying stays in squalid hotels (insect invasions, faulty plumbing, rooms let by the hour); and hellish encounters with the locals (more bad smells, unsavory behavior). Sometimes these 49 tales-introduced by Mary Morris and with a rebuttal by Jan Morris-are amusing, but too often even the authors appear more dutiful than interested, and many stories end patly. The best, however, offer glimpses into the rewards promised by travel-enlightenment, a taste of the exotic, insight into human behavior. Eric Hansen's account of a sleepless winter night passed among the homeless in Grand Central Station and Paul Theroux's claustrophobic Christmas in Central Africa fall into this category; so do Larry O'Connor's moving description of a slum in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and Suzanne Lipsett's encounter with an American couple in Bangkok, circa 1968. All reflect Pico Iyer's belief that "the one great glory of traveling is that hardship is always redeemed by commotion recollected in tranquility." These authors, and half a dozen others, seem changed by their experiences; the rest rather blithely have shrugged theirs off. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Our Marvelous Native Tongue: The Life and Times of the English Language</h2><p>Dustcover with a few clean tear, fixed with tape, book itself in very good condition with clean tight pages.</p><p>Sweeping across centuries and conti nents, Claiborne traces the history of English from its roots in the Danube Valley 8000 years ago to its status to day as native tongue of some 300 mil lion people.

An aging black who has long refused to adopt the black&#39;s traditionally servile attitude is wrongfully accused of murdering a white woman.<b>William Faulkner</b>, one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century, was born in New Albany, Mississippi, on September 25, 1897. He published his first book,&nbsp;<i>The Marble Faun</i>, in 1924, but it is as a literary chronicler of life in the Deep South&#x2014;particularly in the fictional Yoknapatawpha County, the setting for several of his novels&#x2014;that he is most highly regarded. In such novels as<i>&nbsp;The Sound and the Fury</i>,&nbsp;<i>As I Lay Dying</i>,&nbsp;<i>Light in August</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Absalom, Absalom!</i>&nbsp;he explored the full range of post&#x2013;Civil War Southern life, focusing both on the personal histories of his characters and on the moral uncertainties of an increasingly dissolute society. In combining the use of symbolism with a stream-of-consciousness technique, he created a new approach to fiction writing. In 1949 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. William Faulkner died in Byhalia, Mississippi, on July 6, 1962.</p><h2>A Sierra Club Naturalist&#39;s Guide to Southern New England</h2><p>Identifies characteristic plants and animals in diverse ecological communities in New England, exploring the interrelationships among flora, fauna, and geology</p><p></p><h2>Mesmerism and the End of the Enlightenment in France</h2><p>Mesmerism and the End of the Enlightenment in France</p><p><b>Robert Darnton</b> is Professor of History at Princeton University.A fascinating study of the effects that the theories of the notorious Viennese physician, Franz Mesmer, had upon social and political thinkers during the two decades preceding the French Revolution. This book is a skillful exploration of the various psychological factors that made mesmerism a widely accepted attitude...YThe book will interest literary scholars as well as historians since mesmerism is examined as a phenomenon that bequeathed an attitude that found its expression in the writings of the preromantics and the romantics.</p><h2>Something Happened</h2><p>Bob Slocum was living the American dream. He had a beautiful wife, three lovely children, a nice house...and all the mistresses he desired. He had it all -- all, that is, but happiness. Slocum was discontent. Inevitably, inexorably, his discontent deteriorated into desolation until...something happened. Something Happened is Joseph Heller&#39;s wonderfully inventive and controversial second novel satirizing business life and American culture. The story is told as if the reader was overhearing the patter of Bob Slocum&#39;s brain -- recording what is going on at the office, as well as his fantasies and memories that complete the story of his life. The result is a novel as original and memorable as his Catch-22.</p><p>11 1.5-hour cassettesJoseph Heller was born in 1923 in Brooklyn, New York. He served as a bombardier in the Second World War and then attended New York University, Columbia and Oxford University, the last on a Fullbright scholarship. He taught for two years at Pennsylvania State University, before returning to New York, where he began a successful career in the advertising departments of Time, Look and McCall&#39;s magazines. It was during this time that he had the idea for Catch-22. Working on the novel in spare moments and evenings at home, it took him eight years to complete and was first published in 1961. His second novel, Something Happened was published in 1974, Good As Gold in 1979 and Closing Time in 1994. He is also the author of the play &#39;We Bombed in New Haven&#39;.

Lutzer leads readers on a journey to becoming better acquainted with the Lord. After suggested Bible readings at the beginning of each chapter, Lutzer expounds on the biblical text to demonstrate key lessons in pursuing intimacy with God. Lutzer shows how Moses learned to overcome doubt after hearing God&#x2019;s call, how Moses learned to obey God at the burning bush, how Moses came to trust God while wandering in the wilderness, and how Moses obeyed God in leading the nation of Israel. Through these lessons, Lutzer helps believers expose the excuses and idols that come between them and God so that they may be motivated to pursue Him and to &#x201c;draw near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith&#x201d; (Hebrews 10:22 NIV).</p><p>Erwin W.

Made from found stones, and as beautiful as they are durable, pebble mosaics are a welcome addition to gardens, patios, and public spaces. </p><p> <b>The Complete Pebble Mosaic Handbook</b> is the most complete sourcebook for enthusiasts and landscape designers -- an accessible and illustrated guide that covers materials, design, tools and techniques. </p><p> The book lists the best sources to find or buy pebbles; how to choose and test pebbles for strength and quality; and which materials to avoid. There are practical instructions for ensuring the mosaic can withstand frost, foot and vehicle traffic, pollutants, and water. </p><p> The book explains in detail the principles of creating walkways and patios, precast slabs, fountains, pools, and cascades. Illustrated sample projects are followed step-by-step. Designing is also fully explained whether using simple sketches or professional graphic design software. </p><p> A showcase of pebble mosaic from around the world by leading artists demonstrates the craft's vast creative potential. In addition, a section of design ideas features many popular subjects and patterns including animals, heavenly bodies, spirals, borders, floral, fish, flowers, and many more. </p></p><p><p> <b>Maggy Howarth</b> is one of the world's leading authorities on pebble mosaics and author of the bestseller <i>The Art of Pebble Mosaics</i>. </p><p> <b>Foreword</b> </p><p> Is it just coincidence that so many different people enjoy collecting and handling beautiful pebbles? There must be a basic appeal in the pebble as a found object, formed by the great forces of nature, recalling memories of happy childhood days spent on sunny beaches. We are naturally drawn to the smoothness of rounded stone; it's a small and perfect emblem of the earth we walk on. When we pick up a pebble and marvel at its beauty, we are holding a chunk of our planet; and when we pick up handfuls, and arrange them together in patterns, we are reflecting the universe. Children love to do it; so do adults if they give themselves the time to play. Some take the one step further that makes their collection of stones into something more permanent: designing, making and then leaving, for posterity, a pebble mosaic. </p><p> It is now nine years since the publication of <i>The Art of Pebble Mosaics</i>, and a lot has happened in that time. A busy working life, involving many pebble commissions, has led me to some useful discoveries and refinements of the basic techniques. In this book I can share with you some of those new ideas and experiences which I hope will in turn lead to more experimentation and development. </p><p> In addition to research in the workshop, opportunities have also arisen during travel abroad to see for myself some of the marvelous mosaics in far-flung places which have been very little known outside their own countries. Each holiday has become a research trip, trying to take in some of the different pebblework around the world. The photographs and observations are presented here for your delectation. There is so much more out there to discover, and I expect that there will be many more of these adventures -- explorations with eyes down! </p><p> A third source of information has come from readers of the first book. They were invited to contact me with news of any pebble projects of their own. The call didn't fall on stony ground and there has been a steady stream of information about public and private projects, and lots of pictures. Getting those letters and e-mails was like opening a box of delights, each one new and different. Every pair of hands transforms the pebbles differently. The many artists who have contributed to this book and generously shared information show a breadth of vision and invention that is a source of constant joy and admiration. </p><p> What you will see here is the <i>best</i> of pebble mosaic. The criteria for my selection are very simple. Firstly, of course, the work must be principally pebblework (not, say, tesserae). Secondly, it must be good work, and not just anything that happens to be made of pebbles. Sometimes it might be extremely simple, or rough and imperfect, or experimental; it might be quite mundane and everyday, or it might be complex, highly skillful and solidly professional. But, whatever their status, they all have a certain quality in common. They must be either interesting (in whatever way), or original and inventive. I have put in as many as space will permit. Whether or not this can be really thought of as "complete" is a debate for the future. </p><p> In the gazetteer of design ideas at the end of the book you'll find a large collection of pictures and drawings, all of which have been made into pebble mosaics (by me or others) or designed specifically for the medium. A thorough knowledge of pebble mosaic has informed their selection and the drawing of them. It would be wrong of anyone to "copy" them (each design is the copyright of the individual artist); but it is perfectly OK to use them as the inspiration and starting point for new versions. Since time began, artists have fed their imagination from the works of other artists, sparking off new connections and visions. I hope that, in turn, these pages will feed your imagination. That wonderful elusive trigger-point, inspiration, is the vital element that leads, through draftsmanship and selection, to good design. This is what lifts the medium of pebble mosaic from function and craft to a thing of beauty and art. </p><p> Maggy Howarth </p></p><h2>Midas of the Rockies: The Story of Stratton &amp; Cripple Creek (Story of Stratton and Cripple Creek)</h2><p>This reprint makes available again Frank Waters&#x2019; dramatic and colorful 1937 biography of Winfield Scott Stratton, the man who struck it rich at the foot of Pike&#x2019;s Peak and turned Cripple Creek into the greatest gold camp on earth. More than regional history, <b><i>Midas of the Rockies</i></b> is a story so fabulously impossible and yet so painfully true that it commends itself to the whole of America, the only earth, the only people who could have created it.</p><p>Since he began his writing career in 1935, Frank Waters has published many books, among them "The Man Who Killed the Deer," "The Colorado in the Rivers of America" series, "Book of the Hopi," and "Mexico Mystique," <br></p><h2>Vincent by Himself: A Selection of Van Gogh&#39;s Paintings and Drawings Together With Extracts from His Letters</h2><p>An anthology of paintings, drawings, and letters, dating from Van Gogh&#39;s youth to his last years in Arles and Saint Remy, provides a full portrait of Van Gogh&#39;s personality and genius</p><p>Almost identical in format, these two handsome, monumental books share the same subject. To separate the life of this post-Impressionist genius from the nearly 800 letters (600 to brother Theo alone) he wrote during the years from 1880 to 1890, the time of his optimum artistic activities, would be impossible. Vincent's letters are classic revelations of himself; surely he ranks among the world's major letter writers, and both Zurcher and editor Bernard have made a goodly mix from extracts of Vincent's correspondence, matching paintings and drawings. Bernard, however, while presenting the drawings and writings in chronological sections, each one being a portfolio of paintings, merely quotes, while Zurcher interprets and analyzes so that pictures and text are more compelling. This treatment is fuller and richer. Both volumes make use of The Complete Letters of Vincent van Gogh (1978); both display high-quality reproductions in full color, about 151 in Zurcher, 148 in Bernard, plus numerous drawings. Cost-conscious as libraries must be nowadays, the more expensive Zurcher book does have an edge. The biography is more extensive; there is a bibliography, family tree, and added index of Van Gogh's work. Highly recommended for academic art collections. Gloria K.

But what do you really know about Alexander Hamilton? <br><br> Hamilton was no American hero, says author Brion McClanahan. In fact, he spent his life working to make sure citizens and states could not hold the federal government accountable. His policies set a path for presidents to launch secret and illegal wars. And he wanted to make sure American citizens couldn?t do a thing to stop the government's overreach. <br><br> In <i>How Alexander Hamilton Screwed Up America</i>, Brion McClanahan examines the dangers of Hamilton's philosophy, introduces readers to heroes and enemies both new and familiar, and&#x2014;most importantly&#x2014;explains how we can put power back in the hands of the American people.</p><p><strong>Brion McClanahan</strong> holds an M.A. and Ph.D. in American history from the University of South Carolina. Born in Virginia, he attended high school in Delaware and received a B.A. in history from Salisbury University in Maryland. He is the author of <em>9 Presidents Who Screwed Up America</em>, <em>The Founding Fathers Guide to the Constitution</em>, <em>The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Founding Fathers</em>, and <em>The Politically Incorrect Guide to Real American Heroes</em>. He lives with his wife and children near Phenix City, Alabama, just across the river from Columbus, Georgia.<br>&#34;A thinking American must choose between Hamilton and Jefferson, whose contrary visions of the future were contested in the first days of the Constitution. If you are happy with big government, big banks, big business, big military, and judicial dictatorship, then you have Hamilton to thank. His legacy of nationalism, centralization, crony capitalism, and military adventurism is all around us. If you prefer the Jeffersonian version of an American regime (or even if you don&#39;t) McClanahan&#39;s new book is for you. This is not simply a polemic. McClanahan, who is proving to be one of the ablest truly relevant historians of our time, has given us a definitive, deeply-researched chapter and verse and long perspective of who this bad man was and how he is the fountain of our current discontents.&#34; --CLYDE WILSON, professor of history, emeritus, University of South Carolina &#34;Brion McClanahan masterfully shows that we live today in Alexander Hamilton&#39;s dream of America--and this is our chief ailment. The national debt, militaristic foreign policy, and expansive powers for the national government can all be traced to the mind and work of Hamilton. But this book is more than just an indictment of the Hamiltonian program. McClanahan points to a forgotten legacy of decentralization and the beauty of small and vibrant self-governing communities. He challenges us to rediscover First Principles championed by Thomas Jefferson, John Taylor of Caroline, and St. George Tucker. In a time of growing nationalism, this book is a must read for every thinking American.&#34; --WILLIAM J. WATKINS, JR., author of Crossroads for Liberty: Recovering the Anti-Federalist Values of America&#39;s First Constitution &#34;Lin-Manuel Miranda&#39;s Hamilton plays up the heroic angle, essentially ignoring its subject&#39;s misdeeds. Brion McClanahan gets straight to the meat of the matter: Alexander Hamilton&#39;s destructive constitutional legacy. It is not a pretty picture. McClanahan shows that Hamilton&#39;s contemporaries realized what his impact would be at the time, and then provides a forceful account of Hamiltonianism&#39;s effects from the Founders&#39; day to ours. This is essential reading.&#34; --KEVIN GUTZMAN, American constitutional scholar and historian and professor of history at Western Connecticut State University &#34;How Alexander Hamilton Screwed Up America is a must-read book for anyone who wants to know how the American rule of law was transformed into rule by leftist lawyers determined to ignore or destroy all constitutional limits on governmental powers. It was Hamilton and his main disciples, Justices Story, Marshall, and Black, who betrayed the principles of the American founding with such fantasies as &#39;implied powers&#39; of the Constitution. This paved the way for the modern welfare/warfare state which would not exist without Hamilton&#39;s machinations, writes McClanahan. This is the real reason why Alexander Hamilton is the &#39;new hero for the left.&#39; McClanahan exposes Hamilton&#39;s lies, deceptions, and Machiavellian plots to paint a vivid picture of the real Alexander Hamilton.&#34; --DR. THOMAS DILORENZO, professor of economics, Loyola University Maryland, and author of Hamilton&#39;s Curse: How Jefferson&#39;s Arch Enemy Betrayed the American Revolution?and What It Means for Americans Today &#34;Brion McClanahan is that rarity: an historian who tells the truth. Read his expose of the bird on the ten-dollar bill. Not only will you learn a lot the establishment doesn&#39;t want you to know, you&#39;ll have fun doing it.&#34; --LEW ROCKWELL, founder and chairman of the Ludwig von Mises Institute &#34;Today, we live under crushing taxes and debt. And the central government intrudes into nearly every aspect of society, from defining marriage to policing the length of high school students&#39; hair. This was not a revolution where the people amended the Constitution. It was a revolution by members of the central government against the Constitution. How was this possible? Brion McClanahan shows how Alexander Hamilton (who described the Constitution as a &#39;frail and worthless fabric&#39;) created a strategy later followed by others that enabled the central government to become a self-centralizing machine.&#34; --DONALD W. LIVINGSTON, professor of philosophy, emeritus, Emory University &#34;Here&#39;s a rule that will serve you well: whenever a political figure is beloved of all sides, he&#39;s always a scoundrel. Brion McClanahan rips the benign mask off Alexander Hamilton, who is presented in American classrooms as a great hero to celebrate. He is, as Brion shows, one of the original villains in the American story.

Celtic scholar Ellis brings to life the named and unnamed heroines of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, and even Celtic England. Reaching back to the mists of prehistory, Ellis offers evidence that Celtic women were accorded rights that modern women are now winning back. For instance, Shannon Faulkner has had to fight to get into the Citadel, but her distant cousin Boudicca led her people in war against Rome. This is a treasury of material that, while impeccable in its scholarship, is written in accessible and enthusiastic fashion. <i>Patricia Monaghan</i>College-level women's studies programs will appreciate this contribution to women's history: it provides a scholarly study examining the origins of the Celtic goddess and the presence of Celtic female deities, presenting a case for early evidence of women's rights and powers in ancient Celtic society. Women's impact and presence in Celtic society and literature is traced in a fine title which takes modern issues and provides parallels in the ancient world. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>CAR THIEF</h2><p>Alex Housman, who lives in Detroit with his alcoholic father, turns to car theft as an expression of his feelings of rage and helplessness</p><p><b>Theodore Weesner</b>, born in Flint, Michigan, is aptly described as "Writers' Writer" by the larger literary community.

The novel reminds me strongly of the poignant aimlessness of Truffaut&#x2019;s <i>The 400 Blows</i>. Beneath its quiet surface, <i>The Car Thief</i>&#x2014;like its protagonist&#x2014;possesses churning emotions that push up through the prose for resolution.

But what exactly <i>is</i> this monumental, mysterious undertaking? Why did this man, one of the greatest geniuses of the century, a politically militant man himself, suddenly decide to abandon politics and society altogether? As the reader pursues the answer to these questions, two layered narratives emerge. One is a series of unforgettable characters that have transfixed the mathematician&#x2019;s imagination: Chana Abramov, a woman obsessed with painting the same Mexican volcano a thousand times, Vladimir Vostokov, an anarchist in battle with technological modernity, and Maximiliano Cienfuegos, a simple man who will nonetheless become the symbol for the Colonel&#x2019;s as well as Europe&#x2019;s restless political conscience. The other is the protagonist&#x2019;s life story: a picaresque journey that traverses the 20th century: from the Russia of the October Revolution to the Mexico of the anarchic 1920s, from the Spanish Civil War to Vietnam, all the way back to France and from there to the Caribbean islands.

FSG will publish his <i>Collected Stories </i>in June to coincide with the reissue of <i>Sylvia</i>.</p><p>In 1960, after two years of graduate school at Berkeley, I returned to New York without a Ph.D. or any idea what I&#x2019;d do, only a desire to write stories. I&#x2019;d also been to graduate school at the University of Michigan, from 1953 to 1956. All in all, five years of classes in literature. I don&#x2019;t know how else I might have spent those five years, but I didn&#x2019;t want to hear more lectures, study for more exams, or see myself growing old in the library. There was an advertisement in the school paper for someone to take a car from Berkeley to New York, expenses paid. I made a phone call. A few days later, I was driving a Cadillac convertible through mountains and prairies, going back home, an over-specialized man, twenty-seven years old, who smoked cigarettes and could give no better account of himself than to say "I love to read." It doesn&#x2019;t qualify the essential picture, but I had a lot of friends, got along with my parents, and women liked me. Speeding toward the great city in a big, smooth-flowing car that wasn&#x2019;t mine, I felt humored by the world.</p> <p>My parents&#x2019; apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, four rooms and a balcony, was too small for another adult, but I wouldn&#x2019;t be staying long. Anyhow, my mother let me feel like a child. It seemed natural. "What are you doing?" she said. "Washing dishes? Please, please, go away. Sit down. Have a cup of coffee."</p> <p>My father sighed, shook his head, lit a cigar. Saying nothing, he told me that I hadn&#x2019;t done much to make him happy.</p> <p>From their balcony, fourteen stories high, I looked down into Seward Park. Women sat along the benches, chatting. Their children played in the sandbox. Basketball and stick-ball games, on courts nearby, were in process morning and afternoon. On Sundays, a flea market would be rapidly set up in a corner of the park&#x2014;cheap, bright, ugly clothing strewn along the benches. In the bushes, you could talk to a man about hot cameras and TV sets. At night, beneath the lush canopy of sycamores and oaks, prostitutes brought customers. Beyond the park, looking north, I saw Delancey Street, the mouth of the Williamsburg Bridge eating and disgorging traffic. Further north were the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Ever since I was a little kid, I&#x2019;d thought of them as two very important city people. A few degrees to the right, I saw the complicated steelwork of the 59th Street Bridge. To the west, beyond Chinatown (where Arlene Ng, age ten, my first great love, once lived) and beyond Little Italy (where they shot Joey Gallo in Umberto&#x2019;s Clam House on Mulberry Street), loomed Wall Street&#x2019;s financial buildings and the Manhattan Bridge. Trucks, cars, and trains flashed through the grid of cables, crossing the East River to and from Brooklyn. Freighters progressed slowly, as if in a dream, to and from the ocean. In the sky, squadrons of pigeons made grand loops, and soaring gulls made line drawings. There were also streaking sparrows, and airplanes heading toward India and Brazil. All day and night, from every direction, came the hum of the tremendum.</p> <p>I talked for hours on the telephone, telling my friends that I was home, and I sat up late at the kitchen table, drinking coffee, reading, and smoking. Most of the city slept. In the quiet, I heard police sirens as far away as Houston Street. Sometimes, I was awakened around noon or later by the smells of my mother&#x2019;s cooking which, like sunlight, became more subtle as the hours passed. Days were much alike. I didn&#x2019;t know Monday from Wednesday until I saw it in the newspaper. I&#x2019;d forget immediately. After my parents had gone to bed, I&#x2019;d step out to buy The Times, then stare at the columns of want ads. Among thousands upon thousands of jobs, none said my name. I wanted to do something. I didn&#x2019;t want something to do. Across the darkened living room, down the hall, in the big bed with my mother, my father lay snoring.</p> <p>Whatever my regrets about school&#x2014;lost years, no Ph.D.&#x2014;I wasn&#x2019;t yet damaged by judgment. I hadn&#x2019;t failed badly at anything&#x2014;like Francis Gary Powers, for example, whose name I heard every day. His U-2 spy plane had been shot down over Russia, and he&#x2019;d failed to kill himself before being captured. Instead, he confessed to being a spy. President Eisenhower, who claimed the U-2 was a weather plane, looked like a liar.</p> <p>There were few heroes. Malcolm X and Fidel Castro, fantastically courageous, were figures of violent disorder. They had both been in jail. But even in sports, where heroes are simple, they could be the focus of violence. A mob swarmed out of the stands after a ballgame, surrounded the great Mickey Mantle, tore off his hat, clawed his face, and punched him in the jaw so hard they had to take X rays to see if the bone was broken.</p> <p>The odor of fresh newsprint, an oily film on my fingertips, mixed with cigarette smoke and the taste of coffee. Pages turned and crackled like fire, or like breaking bones. I read that 367 were killed in traffic accidents during the Memorial Day weekend, and, since the first automobile, over a million had been killed on our roads, more than in all our wars. And look: Two sisters were found dead in their apartment on Gracie Square, in the bathtub, wearing nightgowns. A razor lay in the hand of one of the sisters. Blood wasn&#x2019;t mentioned. This was old-style journalism, respectfully distanced from personal tragedy. Nothing was said about how the sisters had arranged themselves in the tub. Their life drained away as the crowd vomited out of the stands to worship and mutilate Mickey Mantle. There were really no large meanings, only cries of the phenomena. I read assiduously. I kept in touch with my species.</p> <p>About a week after I arrived, I phoned Naomi Kane, a good pal from the University of Michigan. We&#x2019;d spent many hours together drinking coffee in the Student Union, center of romantic social life, gossip, and general sloth. Naomi, who had grown up in Detroit, in a big, comfortable house with elm trees all around, lived now in Greenwich Village, on the sixth floor of an old brick tenement on MacDougal Street.</p> <p>"Push the street door hard," she said. "There is no bell and the lock doesn&#x2019;t work."</p> <p>From my parents&#x2019; apartment I walked to the subway, caught the F train, took a seat, and was stunned into insentient passivity. The train shrieked through the rock bowels of Manhattan to the West Fourth Street station. I walked up three flights of stairs in the dingy, resonant cavern, then out into the light of a hot Sunday afternoon.</p> <p>Village streets carried slow, turgid crowds of sightseers, especially MacDougal Street, the main drag between Eighth and Bleecker, the famous Eighth Street Bookshop at one end, the famous San Remo bar at the other. I&#x2019;d walked MacDougal Street innumerable times during my high school days, when my girlfriend lived in the Village, and, later, all through college, when my second girlfriend lived in the Village. But I&#x2019;d been gone two years. I hadn&#x2019;t seen these huge new crowds, and new stores and coffeehouses all along the way. I hadn&#x2019;t sensed the new apocalyptic atmosphere.</p> <p>Around then, Elvis Presley and Allen Ginsberg were kings of feeling, and the word love was like a proclamation with the force of kill. The movie Hiroshima, mon amour, about a woman in love with death, was a big hit. So was Black Orpheus, where death is in loving pursuit of a woman. I noticed a graffito chalked on the wall of the West Fourth Street subway station: FUCK HATE. Another read: Mayor Wagner is a lesbian. Wonderfully stupid, I thought, but then the sense came to me. I remembered a newspaper photo showing the city&#x2019;s first meter maids, a hundred strong, in slate blue uniforms. They stood in lines, in a military manner, as Mayor Wagner reviewed them. Ergo: a lesbian. Before 1960, could you have had this thought, made this joke? There had been developments in sensibility, a visionary contagion derived maybe from drugs&#x2014;marijuana, heroin, uppers, downers&#x2014;the poetry of common conversation. Weird delirium was in the air, and in the sluggish, sensual bodies trudging down MacDougal Street. I pressed among them until I came to the narrow, sooty-faced tenement where Naomi lived.</p> <p>I pushed in through the door, into a long hallway painted with greenish enamel, giving the walls a fishy sheen. The hall went straight back through the building to the door of a coffeehouse called The Fat Black Pussy Cat. Urged by the oppressive, sickening green walls, hardly a foot from either shoulder, I walked quickly. Just before the door to The Fat Black Pussy Cat, I came to a stairway with an ironwork banister. I climbed up six flights through the life of the building. A phonograph played blues; an old lady screamed in Italian at a little boy named Bassano; a hall toilet was clattering and flushing, flushing, flushing. At the sixth floor, I turned right and walked down a dark hallway, narrower than the one at street level. No overhead lights burned beyond the landing. There was the glow of a window at the end of the hallway. Brittle waves of old linoleum cracked like eggshells beneath my steps. Naomi&#x2019;s door, formerly the entrance to an office, had a clouded glass window. I knocked. She opened. With a great hug, she welcomed me into a small kitchen.</p> <p>Behind her, I saw a refrigerator and stove. A half-wall partition separated the kitchen from the living room, with a gap that let you pass through. The partition served as a shelf for a telephone, papers, books, and pieces of clothing. A raw brick wall dominated the living room. The floor was wide, rough, splintery planks, as in a warehouse. It was strewn with underwear, shoes, and newspapers. Light, falling through a tall window, came from the west. The window looked over rooftops all the way to the Hudson River, then beyond to the cliffs of New Jersey. Another tall window, in the kitchen, looked east across MacDougal Street at a tenement just like this one. I supposed that Naomi&#x2019;s apartment, in the middle of Greenwich Village, must be considered desirable. Naomi said, "Don&#x2019;t make wisecracks. The rent is forty bucks a month." Then she introduced me to Sylvia Bloch.</p> <p>She stood barefoot in the kitchen dragging a hairbrush down through her long, black, wet Asian hair. Minutes ago, apparently, she had stepped out of the shower, which was a high metal stall in the kitchen, set on a platform beside the sink. A plastic curtain kept water from splashing onto the kitchen floor. She said hello but didn&#x2019;t look at me. Too much engaged, tipping her head right and left, tossing the heavy black weight of hair like a shining sash. The brush swept down and ripped free until, abruptly, she quit brushing, stepped into the living room, dropped onto the couch, leaned back against the brick wall, and went totally limp. Then, from behind long black bangs, her eyes moved, looked at me. The question of what to do with my life was resolved for the next four years.</p> <p>Sylvia was slender and suntanned. Her hair fell below the middle of her back. Long bangs obscured her eyes, making her look shy or modestly hiding, and also shorter than average. She was five-six. Her eyes, black as her hair, were quick and brilliant. She had a high fine neck, wide shoulders, narrow hips, delicately shaped wrists and ankles. Her figure and the smooth length of her face, with its wide sensuous mouth, reminded me of Egyptian statuary. She wore a weightless cotton Indian dress with an intricate flowery print. It was the same brown hue as her skin.</p> <p>We sat in the living room until Naomi&#x2019;s boyfriend arrived. He was black, tall, light complexioned. Mixed couples were common, especially with Jewish women, but I was surprised. Conversation was awkward for me, determined not to stare at Sylvia. The summer heat and the messy living room with its dirty floor destroyed concentration, discouraged talk. Things were said, but it was dull obligatory stuff. Mainly we perspired and looked at one another. After a while, Naomi suggested we go for a walk. I was relieved and grateful. We all got up and left the apartment and went down into the street, staying loosely together, heading toward Washington Square Park. Naomi came up beside me and whispered, "She&#x2019;s not beautiful, you know."</p> <p>The remark embarrassed me. My feelings were too obvious. I&#x2019;d been hypnotized by Sylvia&#x2019;s flashing exotic effect. Naomi sounded vaguely annoyed, as though I&#x2019;d disappointed her. She wanted to talk, wanted to put me straight, but we weren&#x2019;t alone. I said "Ummm." Incapable of anything better, I was literally meaningless. Naomi then said, as if she were making a concession, "Well, she is very smart."</p> <p>We were supposed to have dinner together and go to a movie, but Naomi and her boyfriend disappeared, abandoning Sylvia and me in the park. Neither of us was talking. We&#x2019;d become social liabilities, too stupid with feeling to be fun. We continued together, as if dazed, drifting through dreamy heat. We&#x2019;d met for the first time less than an hour ago, yet it seemed we&#x2019;d been together, in the plenitude of this moment, forever. We walked for blocks without becoming flirtatious, barely glancing at each other, staying close. Eventually, we turned back toward the tenement; with no reason, no words, slowly turning back through the crowded streets, then into the dismal green hall and up six flights of stairs, and into the squalid apartment, like a couple doomed to a sacrificial assignation. It started without beginning. We made love until afternoon became twilight and twilight became black night.</p> <p></p> <p>Excerpted from Sylvia by Leonard Michaels.<br>Copyright 1990, 1992 by Leonard Michaels.<br>Published in Edition, 2007 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux.<br>All rights reserved.

Set in a facetious near-future that is both mind-bendingly bizarre and achingly familiar. <i>Sayonara, Gangsters</i> is an inventive novel about language, expression and the creative process that unfolds through hilarious sketches. The peaceful if bizarre life of a poetry teacher is forever transformed by a group of terrorists called "the gangsters" in what is, incredibly, a semi-autobiographical novel. <br><br>On this literary gonzo trip in which a man of letters finds out, too late, that flirting with extremist politics can have unsavory conequences for one's mind, we encounter the likes of Virgil, the refrigerator (a memorable three-dimesional character) and "Henry IV" the feline aficionado of books. Endlessly resourceful, relentlessly erudite, but always accessible, <i>Sayonara, Gangsters</i> is a unique masterpiece of literary postmodernism that aims to entertain rather than to intimidate. <br><br>From the outrageous beginning, which reads like an oblique reference to the war on terror but is no such thing (it was written more than twenty years ago), to the sobering, devastating end, through the lyrical, poignant middle, Takahashi's legendary first novel is candy for your brain. <i>Sayonara, Gangsters</i> is a must-read for all fans of world literature, available for the first time in English.</p><p>Genichiro Takahashi never graduated from Yokohama National University. As a student radical, he was arrested and spent half a year in prison, a harrowing experience that rendered him incapable of reading or writing for several years. <i>Sayonara, Gangsters</i> took the literary establishment by storm and remains one of the summits of postmodern writing in Japanese or any other language. Winner of the Mishima and other coveted literary awards, Takahashi has been the best-kept secret of readers of Japanese. <i>Sayonara, Gangsters</i> is his first full-length work to be published in English.Takahashi's first novel to be translated into English can be amusing, sexy, moving, intelligent and maddeningly obtuse-often all at the same time. Which is exactly what Takahashi, acclaimed author of postmodernist romps and former porn director, intends. Somewhere in a future time and place, people have no names. Lovers find this inconvenient, so they begin naming each other. The two main characters settle on the following names: the woman is the Nakajima Miyuki Song Book, and the man, who teaches at a poetry school, is Sayonara, Gangsters. Their cat, who prefers milk-and-vodka and is a great fan of Aristotle, is named Henry IV. The first of the book's three parts tells the story of Sayonara, Gangsters's former lover, "the woman," and their daughter, named both Caraway and Green Pinky. One day the couple receive a postcard from City Hall that reads, "We Were So Sorry to Learn of the Death of Your Daughter." Sayonara, Gangster then describes Caraway's removal to the Children's Graveyard, where she is deposited in a cork-lined metal case. In the second section, Sayonara, Gangster explains his work at the poetry school, with a long disquisition on the death of poetry by the poet Virgil, who has metamorphosed into a refrigerator. The last section is an action-filled account of three gangsters who come to be taught poetry and who are killed after a gunfight with a detachment of armored police. Emmerich's playfully virtuosic translation makes all this more fun than work, rendering Takahashi's mischievous tale in candy-coated prose. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It promptly established itself as a classic in the philosophy of language and has held that position ever since. With many examples from a vast multitude of languages, from Sanskrit to Delaware Indian, the author shows how character and structure of a language expresses the inner life and knowledge of its speakers and how their intellectual development is in turn shaped by their language.</p></p><p>Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767-1835), German man of letters and diplomat, was also an extraordinary philologist.<p>The Objective of the Present Treatise</p><p>The distribution of human beings into races and tribes and the variation in their languages and dialects are certainly closely related, but both of these result primarily from the productivity of human intellectual power in all its forms. It is in the creation of human intellectual power that they find their recognition and their explanation to the extent that research is able to penetrate the relationship between them. This revelation of human intellectual power about the earth during the course of millennia, varying in type and degree, constitutes the ultimate goal of all intellectual activity; it is, moreover, the ultimate idea which the history of the world must clearly strive to produce.</p><p>This expansion of the intellectual life is the sole possession that the individual, to the extent that he participates, may regard as indestructible. And in a nation it represents that entity from which, in turn, great individualities unfailingly develop. Comparative linguistics, or the precise investigation of the diversity through which innumerable peoples resolve the problem of linguistic structure imposed upon them as human beings, fails to attract serious interest unless its relationship to the pattern of national intellectual power is made clear. But the insight into the actual nature of a nation and into the internal relationships of an individual language, as well as its relationship to linguistic requirements in general, depends entirely upon consideration of the total intellectual individuality. For this alone, dictated by nature and its milieu, furnishes the articulation for the character of the nation. Upon its heritage alone, consisting of an accumulation of deeds, institutions, and productive ideas, is based the nation's character and rests its dignity and the power to continue itself diachronically down to posterity. Language [human speech] on the other hand is the organ of the internal being, this self that progressively achieves internal cognition and enunciation. All of its tiniest rootlets are anchored firmly in the national intellectual potential. The more appropriately the latter reacts upon it, the more principled and richer its development. As language in its intricacies is but an effect of the national linguistic sense, those problems concerning the complex structuring of languages (from which also stem their most important variables) cannot be solved adequately if one does not subscribe to this viewpoint. Material cannot, of course, be sought there for that which is inherently restricted to historical treatment by comparative linguistics. Nevertheless, an insight into the original concatenation of facts and a comprehension of language as an internally cohesive organism may be obtained. These, in turn, aid in a correct appraisal of individual factors.</p><p>Observation of the connection between linguistic variation and the distribution of tribes on the one hand, and the production of human intellectual power on the other, as a relationship developing progressively in varying degree and in new configurations, is the theme with which this treatise will be concerned, insofar as these two phenomena are capable of clarifying each other.</p></p><h2>Towervale</h2><p>NEW HARDCOVER.

Anthony Rotundo sweeps away the groundless assumptions and myths that inform the current fascination with men's lives. Opposing the views of men's movement leaders and best-selling authors who maintain that manliness is eternal and unchanging, Rotundo stresses that our concept of manhood is man-made and that, like any human invention, it has a history. <i>American Manhood</i> is a fascinating account of how our understanding of what it means to be a man has changed over time.</p><p><b>E. Anthony Rotundo</b> teaches history and develops programs on race and gender at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.A fascinating, accessible, and meticulous piece of scholarship, this study of changing conceptions of manhood breaks new ground in uncovering the internal struggles and shifting paradigms that have informed American men's understanding of themselves. Borrowing the innovative techniques of women's history and gender studies, Rotundo (History/Phillips Academy) shines a powerful light on the diaries, letters, and institutions of white, northern, middle-class men. From a Puritan society that conceived of men largely as ranked members of a community, America, he says, was transformed into a place where a man was an individual who created his own place and status. The qualities that were valued in a man were likewise transformed, from an ideal that called for the suppression of aggressive, competitive urges to an image of manliness that valued nothing more. While boys were once seen as separate from men--at times, more like females; later, as a host of antisocial impulses that need to be suppressed--by the end of the 19th century, men (with Theodore Roosevelt as paradigm) were seen as overgrown boys, their boyish impulses being their best part. Similarly, men's relation to women, while never abjuring the underlying framework of gender spheres, has repeatedly shifted to buttress men's superiority. Sexuality, too, Rotundo says, has changed profoundly, and not always in ways we would think: The 18th century lacked a true concept of homosexuality, allowing adult male friends to spend the night in each others' arms--an act inconceivable to most contemporary heterosexuals. While the slice of society Rotundo examines is narrow, what he reveals goes deep. A pioneering work. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

With &#x201c;the gleeful viperish wit of Dorothy Parker&#x201d; (Slate), Kipnis now offers a fresh and provocative assessment of the female condition in the post-post-feminist world of the twenty-first century. For every advance toward sexual equality on the part of women in recent years, she argues, some new impediment just &#x201c;seems&#x201d; to appear. Ironically, feminism ran up against an unanticipated opponent: the inner woman. <br><br>An ambitious and original reassessment of feminism and women&#x2019;s ambivalence about it, <i>The Female Thing</i> brims with bracing and funny social observations informed by psychological acuity. For all the upbeat &#x201c;You go, girl&#x201d; slogans, women remain caught between feminism and femininity, between self-affirmation and an endless quest for self-improvement, between playing the injured party and claiming independence. Feminism is bedeviled by the same impasses and contradictions it seeks to rectify. But rather than blaming the usual suspects&#x2013;men, the media&#x2013;Kipnis takes a hard look at culprits closer to home, namely women themselves and their complicity in upholding male privilege, even as they resent men deeply for it. Which makes relations between the sexes rather thorny at the moment, and Kipnis serves up the gory details of the mutual displeasure between men and women in painfully hilarious detail. <br><br>In the tradition of <i>The Feminine Mystique</i> and <i>The Female Eunuch</i>, this is a pathbreaking work. As audacious as it is historically and socially grounded, <i>The Female Thing</i> explores age-old quandaries: the war between the sexes, what women &#x201c;really&#x201d; want, and to what extent anatomy is destiny after all.</p><p>Laura Kipnis is a professor of media studies at Northwestern University. She has received fellowships and grants from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts. She is the author of many essays and articles on sexual politics and contemporary culture, and of the book <i>Against Love: A Polemic</i>.1<br><br> ENVY<br><br> Over the course of human history, cultures have endlessly vacillated when it comes to describing the differences between the sexes. For some reason, there&#x2019;s been a certain fickleness. A male characteristic in one society is a female characteristic in another; at one moment men and women are opposites that attract, at another they&#x2019;re counterparts who repel; they&#x2019;re essentially similar or they&#x2019;re essentially different, though typically not both at once. Whereas in our time, in the wake of feminism and the commotion about &#x201c;roles&#x201d; and the consequent sexual unrest, it&#x2019;s now entirely possible for women to be both different and similar to men simultaneously, which promotes a certain confusion among the gal set, bouncing back and forth like tennis balls between competing theories of what women naturally are versus what women can become, or whether women should act more like men (&#x201c;strong&#x201d;) or more like powerful women (&#x201c;strong&#x201d;), at least once the remaining impediments to gender equality are finally overcome (society, bad self-esteem, the wage gap).<br><br> In other words, being female at this point in history is an especially conflicted enterprise, like Birkstenstocks with Chanel, or trying to frown after a Botox injection. But we should be getting used to it, since looking back thirty years or so, you can see the same dichotomies already peeking out from behind contending brands of second-wave feminism. In one corner we had Feminism Plan A: Strive for empowerment, smash those glass ceilings, sport-fuck like the guys, celebrate &#x201c;strong women&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;You go, Mrs. Thatcher&#x201d;&#x2014;and impugn the intelligence of the opposite sex with frequency. In the other corner was Feminism Plan B: Demand respect for women&#x2019;s inherent differences from men, for our nurturing capacities, our innate moral compass, our emotional intuitiveness, our built-in process-oriented . . . you know . . . process. Women&#x2019;s power inheres in our bodies, our childbearing capabilities, our female sensuality&#x2014;all of which deeply terrify men and society.<br><br> So which one should it be? The Feisty Feminist or the Eternal Feminine, careers or motherhood, ballsy or baby-doll&#x2014;or why not all at once! But the truly fascinating question is how it came about that whichever one you chose, what was once construed as a liberation movement somehow ended up producing more dichotomies and more impasses and the perennial sense that despite everything that&#x2019;s been gained, something&#x2019;s invariably missing. Of course, in hindsight we see that under Plan A, women demanded to have what men have, without stopping to consider whether it was worth having, or whether men really even possessed it in the first place&#x2014;and that &#x201c;empowerment&#x201d; was always a word with a certain overcompensatory ring to it. And that under Plan B, the essential-womanhood thing quickly started looking like an updated version of traditional femininity, especially once the whole goddess-worshipping New Age veneer got scratched off.<br><br> So where does that leave gender progress?<br><br> Let&#x2019;s recall that a long time before either Plan A or Plan B came down the pike, femininity was already an &#x201c;empowerment program&#x201d; for women. Appearances to the contrary, femininity was never about being some kind of delicate flower; it was tactical: a way of securing resources and positioning women as advantageously as possible on an uneven playing field, given the historical inequalities and anatomical disparities that make up the wonderful female condition. Femininity was the method for creatively transforming female disadvantages into advantages, basically by doing what it took to form strategic alliances with men: enhancing women&#x2019;s appeal and sexual attractiveness with time-honored stratagems like ritual displays of female incompetence aimed at subtly propping up men&#x2019;s (occasionally less than secure) sense of masculine prowess. Thus, lacking body mass, women made a virtue out of delicacy (often a rather steely delicacy); stuck with not just bearing but also raising the children, women promoted the sanctity of motherhood; deprived of upper-body strength, women made men carry things; afflicted by capricious hormonal fluctuations, women used crying as a form of interpersonal leverage; restricted from the public sphere, women commandeered domestic life; shut out of decent employment, gals adopted a &#x201c;pay-to-play&#x201d; strategy&#x2014;men had to pay for sex, with dinners, rings, and homes. Men are also required to kill spiders. All this took some considerable effort: achieving what looks like a passive aim often requires large amounts of activity, as someone once said. (Okay, it was Freud.) The point is that femininity assumes that the world isn&#x2019;t going to change and endeavors to secure advantages for women on that basis.*<br><br> Then came feminism. Feminists saw the unequal playing field differently: they wanted to level it. Feminism assumes that things can change&#x2014;even men&#x2014;and bets the bankroll on gender progress. There&#x2019;s no doubt that feminism has claimed a lot of social terrain over the last three or four decades, has made numerous inroads into the female psyche and overhauled gender identities across the population, even among those who don&#x2019;t talk the talk. Face it, we all inhabit a postfeminist world: it was, after all, feminism that brought women equal treatment under the law, voting rights, access to public life, some progress toward pay equity, and so on, and even among the most diehard &#x201c;I like being a woman&#x201d; set, you don&#x2019;t find too many arguing with the right to own property or wanting to hand back the vote or anything silly like that.<br><br> If the female condition seems especially perplexing at the moment, the reason, it becomes evident, is that women are left straddling two rather incompatible positions. Feminism (&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t call me honey, dickhead&#x201d;) and femininity (&#x201c;I just found the<br><br> *It has sometimes been argued that the conditions of femininity have been imposed by patriarchy. Feel free to tell the story this way around, if you prefer&#x2014;that is, if you don&#x2019;t mind reducing women to the status of passive receptacles as opposed to agents.<br><br> world&#x2019;s best push-up bra!&#x201d;) are in a big catfight, nowhere more than within each individual female psyche. The femininity adherents aren&#x2019;t giving up their social rights, while even most diehard feminists aren&#x2019;t about to surrender the advantages that can be secured through deploying femininity when possible&#x2014;not these days, especially not those of a heterosexual bent. (Honk if you&#x2019;re pro-choice on cosmetics.)<br><br> The main reason that feminism and femininity are incompatible is that femininity has a nasty little secret, which is this: femininity, at least in its current incarnation, hinges on sustaining an underlying sense of female inadequacy. Feminism, on the other hand, wants to eliminate female inadequacy, to trounce it as a patriarchal myth, then kick it out of the female psyche for good. The two continue to battle it out, nowhere more than within women&#x2019;s relations to their bodies, which is to say, within the entirety of the female self-relation.<br><br> Let&#x2019;s begin with a case study. Our subject is feminist heroine Eve Ensler, the author-impresario behind the worldwide theatrical phenomenon The Vagina Monologues. This was followed by The Good Body, a one-woman show centering on Ensler&#x2019;s tormented relationship with her slightly protruding post-forties abdomen. According to Ensler, after having said the word &#x201c;vagina&#x201d; in public close to a million times, having thought she&#x2019;d come to terms with possessing a vagina herself, she finally realized that the self-hatred had merely migrated upward to her stomach. Between the obsessive dieting, the exercise, and the agonizing, given all the emotional energy funneled into her stomach over the years, Ensler laments, that pot belly has been her most significant relationship. Note that even a self-proclaimed radical feminist can&#x2019;t seem to simply jettison the stratagems of femininity or the norms of beauty culture, despite being armed to the teeth with feminist theory and analysis. Early in the evening, the audience is treated to the self-loathing-feminist equivalent of a money shot, with Ensler yanking blouse up and waistband down, and yes, there in all its naked shame, perched upon a perfectly acceptable body, is indeed a small pot. Ensler works herself into intellectual knots trying to come to terms with these painful body insecurities, but there&#x2019;s a simple explanation for the dilemma she can&#x2019;t quite decipher, which is that feminism and femininity just aren&#x2019;t reconcilable. Though if only internal gymnastics burned calories, we could all have flatter stomachs, with far fewer hours at the fucking gym.<br><br> In other words, the drawback to femininity, as currently construed, is that it can never be successfully attained. Or not once consumer culture got into the act, since in this configuration, femininity revolves around the anxiety of female defectiveness to perpetuate itself. Between the truckloads of instruction, the endless guidance, the chirpy &#x201c;helpful hints,&#x201d; perpetuating insufficiency is clearly the objective. In fact, a better name for contemporary femininity would be the feminine-industrial complex, a vast psychocommercial conglomerate financed by women themselves (though any sex can profiteer) and devoted to churning out fantastic solutions to the alarming array of psychological problems you didn&#x2019;t know you had (&#x201c;Are You a Love Addict?&#x201d;; &#x201c;Do You Have Night Eating Syndrome?&#x201d;); social hazards you hadn&#x2019;t even considered (dangerous infections from unsanitized pedicure bo...</p><h2>Cold Beer and Crocodiles: A Bicycle Journey into Australia</h2><p>A New England-born author and journalist describes his nine-month, ten-thousand-mile journey through Australia by bicycle, detailing the cattle stations, mining towns, Aboriginal communities, rain forests, deserts, and other sights of the Australian Outback. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>It's not every day that a fellow decides to pack in a good job, pack up his saddlebags, and set off by bicycle to make a circumferential journey around Australia. In 1996, that's just what American-born <i>Time</i> magazine correspondent Roff Martin Smith did, though; as he explains, he'd been living in Australia for 14 years but didn't really know the country, and he "felt no emotional bond to it." About to turn 38, a few pounds over his ideal weight, and untested as a distance bicyclist, Smith faced up to considerable odds, but he survived to tell the tale.<p> And a rollicking tale it is, as Smith meets with an odd assortment of humans and critters along his sometimes torturous path. (One all-too-long stretch of road, for instance, he calls "the most dangerous and frightening I've ever had the misfortune to ride: a suicide run of hammering trucks, heavy construction, muddy detours, and lane closures.") Smith logs time in crocodile country, too, in the far northern Australian rainforest, where he counts the awful moments until antediluvian doom strikes. It never does, and in any event the crocs are nothing compared to the errant sheep, emus, kangaroos, and death adders he encounters, to say nothing of the 108-degree gusts euphemistically referred to by local weathercasters as "sea breezes"--none of which poses quite the dangers that his fellow humans offer out on the beery highways of Oz. Difficult though the journey is, Smith keeps up his good cheer throughout these lively pages, and, if he's not quite unflappable, he's certainly a sympathetic narrator.</p><p> Expanded from his popular three-part series in <i>National Geographic</i> magazine, Smith's pedal-powered epic is an instructive manual for anyone contemplating a life-changing journey--and, for the rest of us, a highly enjoyable, altogether unexpected tour of the outback. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Smith relates the story of his bicycle trek through Australia in this amazing travel account. The New Englander, who has lived in Australia for the past 15 years, had never taken the time to see the country and realized he had no feel for the nature and character of Australia. Restless, he impulsively quit his prestigious job to embark on this journey. His adventure takes him through cities, mountains, deserts, and incredibly remote outback villages. Pitting himself against nature's harshest elements, Smith battles steep hills, headwinds, 140-degree heat, tropical storms, and xenophobia with a strength of purpose that rarely falters. Along the way, he crosses paths with a number of hostile and unsavory characters, but it is the surprising kindness and generosity of most of the people that touch him the most and teach him what it means to be "Australian." Smith set out as a foreigner, but he returned with a new and profound understanding and appreciation of that beautiful country and its people. The story of Smith's initiation into his adopted culture proves to be an engaging read. <i>Gavin Quinn</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Ordinary citizens were rioting in the streets, but their demonstrations met with indifference, and dissidents were jailed. Canada emerged from the Great Depression a different nation. <br>The most searing decade in Canada's history began with the stock market crash of 1929 and ended with the Second World War. With formidable story-telling powers, Berton reconstructs its engrossing events vividly: the Regina Riot, the Great Birth Control Trial, the black blizzards of the dust bowl and the rise of Social Credit. The extraordinary cast of characters includes Prime Minister Mackenzie King, who praised Hitler and Mussolini but thought Winston Churchill "one of the most dangerous men I have ever known"; Maurice Duplessis, who padlocked the homes of private citizens for their political opinions; and Tim Buck, the Communist leader who narrowly escaped murder in Kingston Penitentiary. <br>In this #1 best-selling book, Berton proves that Canada's political leaders failed to take the bold steps necessary to deal with the mass unemployment, drought and despair.

It gives your body its shape and the ability to move. It grows and changes with you, an undeniable document of who you are and how you lived. Arguably, no other part of the human anatomy has such rich scientific and cultural significance, both brimming with life and a potent symbol of death. <br><br>In this delightful natural and cultural history of bone, Brian Switek explains where our skeletons came from, what they do inside us, and what others can learn about us when these artifacts of mineral and protein are all we've left behind. <br><br>Bone is as embedded in our culture as it is in our bodies. Our species has made instruments and jewelry from bone, treated the dead like collectors' items, put our faith in skull bumps as guides to human behavior, and arranged skeletons into macabre tributes to the afterlife. Switek makes a compelling case for getting better acquainted with our skeletons, in all their surprising roles. Bridging the worlds of paleontology, anthropology, medicine, and forensics, <i>Skeleton Keys</i> illuminates the complex life of bones inside our bodies and out.</p><p><b>Brian Switek</b> is a collection of 206-some-odd bones and associated soft tissues. He's also the author of the books <i>My Beloved Brontosaurus </i>and <i>Written in Stone</i>, as well as the <i>Scientific American</i> blog <i>Laelaps.</i> His bylines have appeared in <i>National Geographic, Smithsonian, Wired, Slate, The Wall Street Journal, Nature</i>, and other publications. He lives in Salt Lake City, Utah.Introduction<br><br> CUT&nbsp; TO&nbsp; THE&nbsp; BONE <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>When Geza Uirmeny decided to take his own life, he turned to a blade. Precisely what was tormenting the seventy- year-old Eastern European shepherd is a secret kept by his remains. The tiny placard affixed beneath his toothless skull in a cabinet of wood and glass at downtown Philadelphia&#x2019;s M�tter Museum doesn&#x2019;t say whether it was financial stress, heartache, or any of the other painful circumstances of human life that led him to choose his own way out. But the postmortem grin formed by his jaws speaks to what happened next.<br> What Uirmeny didn&#x2019;t know when he raised the cutting edge to his neck was that part of his throat had transformed to bone. This happens to everyone to a greater or lesser extent. The flexible carti- lage of your larynx&#x2014;the ringed tube that gives you that distinctive part of yourself, your voice&#x2014;slowly but surely starts to change as you age, rigid bone cells growing in place of the more pliant flesh. <br>Uirmeny&#x2019;s tissues were a little more ambitious than most. As he swiped the blade across his neck, he met unexpected resistance. His larynx had been so transmuted that it formed a bony strut in his neck; in the more clinical terms of the M�tter Museum&#x2019;s signage, &#x201c;Wound not fatal because of ossified larynx.&#x201d; That little note doesn&#x2019;t record what Uirmeny felt when he realized his failure, but the scar that must have formed on his neck was a mark of a happier ending. Uirmeny, the display says, &#x201c;lived until 80 without melancholy.&#x201d; Bone saved Uirmeny&#x2019;s life.<br> The lucky herdsman&#x2019;s skull is one of 139 in the <i>Hyrtl Skull Collection </i>exhibit, the last resting place for dozens of people who perished during the second half of the nineteenth century in Central and Eastern Europe. Each skull has its own story, recounted in a passive voice shorthand that makes the collected tales swing between the somber and the tragicomic. There&#x2019;s the bony grin of Francisca Sey- cora, a nineteen-year-old Viennese prostitute who died of meningi- tis, next to that of Veronica Huber, a woman executed for murdering her child. They share the space with rail workers, fishermen, ban- dits, soldiers, and the unidentified dead, as well as a few stranger cases. There&#x2019;s the cranium of Andrejew Sokoloff, a member of an extreme religious sect who died following the order&#x2019;s dire require- ment of self-emasculation; and the skull of Girolamo Zini, a twenty- year-old tightrope walker who, the museum&#x2019;s deadpan delivery tells us, &#x201c;died of atlanto-axial dislocation (broken neck).&#x201d;<br> These crania aren&#x2019;t the only bones in the M�tter&#x2019;s expansive and historic collection. In addition to housing slices of Einstein&#x2019;s brain and larger-than-life replicas of every eye injury imaginable, which sympathy pain prevented me from giving any more than a sideways glance, the M�tter Museum is home to the towering skeleton of the M�tter American Giant, the remains of a woman so tightly corseted for so long that the garments changed the very structure of her bones, and dozens of other people whose final act is to educate the rest of us about what lives inside. This is a place populated by the remarkable dead, a medical mausoleum with a nineteenth-century aesthetic that would make a Victorian-era anatomy student feel right at home. There&#x2019;s more than a touch of the gothic about the rows of cases, not to mention a sinister feeling that you, too, might have been eyed for an exhibit had you lived during the museum&#x2019;s heyday&#x2014;anatomists of old would often let their ethics slip if it meant acquiring another remarkable specimen for their cabinets. These bones have taken on a second life, and that&#x2019;s part of the story as much as the lives stripped down and presented among the cases and shelves. Every bone in the collection embodies a tangle of stories leading from the present back through history, and deeper still through the millions of years of evolutionary assembly that made us into our present and still-changing form. In each skeleton, whether that person was privileged or poor, healthy or afflicted, there are stories of varied and resilient <i>life</i>.<br> Admittedly, I hadn&#x2019;t paid very close attention to human bones before my visit to the M�tter that cold February morning. My affec- tion for bones had its origin in paleontology.<br> I lived just an hour from the M�tter for most of my life, and I al- ways promised myself I&#x2019;d visit at an unspecified <i>sometime</i>. When I found myself with enough time and cash to visit a museum, though, I&#x2019;d always opt instead to go north on NJ Transit to visit the hulking frames of dinosaurs and other prehistoric oddities in Manhattan&#x2019;s American Museum of Natural History. Petrified bones of all shapes and sizes fascinated me, even more glorious raised and reconstructed in their life positions.<br> That enduring affection led me to settle in the American West, where I spend weeks out of each summer helping museum and uni- versity field crews dig up fragile bones that throw open windows to lost worlds. It&#x2019;s difficult work. Out in the desert, science is a matter of stomping around crumbling outcrops in search of pieces of pre- historic lives that have miraculously survived to the present, using pick, shovel, brush, and plaster to uncover and cradle old bones before using whatever strength you can muster to drag them out of their natural tombs. All that manual labor offers plenty of time to think, of course, and the endless stream of questions that bones in- spire helps those wracked with fossil fever endure sunburn, gnat bites, dehydration, and cactus needles that seem to know the exact weak spot of your boots.<br> What was this creature? What did it look like? How did it move? What did it eat? These are puzzles that can be answered through bone. Each element has stories to tell, a record of the organism&#x2019;s life wrapped up in its skeleton. To the paleontologist, bones are not grim visages of death. Skeletons are biological time capsules that tell us of lives we&#x2019;ll never see in the flesh. A tooth. A string of vertebrae. An osteoderm that once acted as bony armor inside the skin. These were all living tissues that had to grow and were constantly changing within the bodies of the animals they once belonged to. Even the ti- niest, most boring fragment of unidentifiable Chunkasaurus gradu- ally turning to powder beneath the unforgiving sun is a vestige of a life come, gone, and preserved for a span of time that&#x2019;s impossible to truly understand. It&#x2019;s difficult to push away thoughts about life while facing death. This is as true for us as it was for <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>.<br> Gently, insistently interrogating the remains of long-dead crea- tures makes every tidbit of information drawn from their skeletons a treasure. We don&#x2019;t get to see them in life, so bones are most of what we have. (Tracks and traces form a supplement to the skeletons.) The entire paleontological discipline is based on resurrecting the ex- tinct, if only in our minds.<br> With our own bones, though, the connection flips. We intimately experience life and are familiar with all the squishy tissues that skel- etons support. With the knowledge of the living, then, the meaning of human bones is often pulled inside out. A skull is a death&#x2019;s-head, reminding us of what awaits us all. &#x201c;As I am now, so will you be. As you are now, so once was I.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what human skeletal remains re- peat to us over and over again. Just think of where we see skeletons and skulls around us. A skull and crossbones marks the menacing flutter of the Jolly Roger. A similar symbol warns us we&#x2019;ll die if we&#x2019;re careless about what containers we drink from. Heavy metal album covers are rife with skeletons, as are the ranks of fictional villains, from Skeletor to the bony army in <i>The 7th Voyage of Sinbad</i>. Tat- tooed onto my left forearm, a werewolf grips the skull of one of her victims in an anthropomorphic memento mori. Even Death itself comes to us as a robed skeleton. One of the few positive cultural as- sociations with skeletons we seem to have is the Mexican Dia de los Muertos, a holiday when sugar skulls and other osteological adorn-<br> ments help keep the living in touch with the memory of those who<br> have left us. But that&#x2019;s largely an exception to our modern relation- ship with bones. While prehistoric remains represent life resurrected and reassembled, we often think of our own bones as potent sym- bols of the afterlife and what misfortune may come to snatch us away into it.<br> Still, deep down, we can&#x2019;t escape the fact that bones are the most vital of structures. They form the foundation of our lives from the outset. We don&#x2019;t squeeze out of our mothers fully formed, all of our 206-some-odd bones in place. No, when we start life our bones still have to fully ossify and fuse, years and years of development and growth ahead of us that will alter our skeletons as the years tick&nbsp; by. Our bones change throughout our childhood and adolescence, eventually bringing us to our full stature, and if we&#x2019;re lucky enough to reach old age, they can even turn against us, resorbing themselves before we&#x2019;re finished using them. These changes don&#x2019;t happen in fits and starts. Bone is always being altered. Even now, as you&#x2019;re reading this, specialized, voracious cells are eating up old bone as other cel- lular blobs are creating new bone cells, recycling your body from the inside. So even though there&#x2019;s a useful distinction between flesh and bone, it really only comes down to soft versus hard. Bone is every bit as lively and responsive as the skin that hides all the muscle and gore draped around your skeleton.<br> Bone, in scientific jargon, is &#x201c;a vascularized tissue consisting of osteocytes with multiple interconnecting processes, embedded in an extracellular matrix, mineralized with hydroxyapatite, and contain- ing type I collagen.&#x201d; Like many scientific definitions, this manages to be correct and totally miss the larger point at the same time. Yes, bone is a durable, mineralized tissue made of a hard part and a flex- ible part, but it&#x2019;s also one of the most fantastic building materials that evolution has accidentally spit out. In us bone is a structural core, giving our bodies support while also acting as a foundation for our flesh and internal protection that wraps around our vital organs. It never moves by itself but is essential to our ability to move. Bone has manifested itself in wings, sails, horns, armor, and an even greater array of appendages and ornaments that have been accumulating since the time of its origin. Bone is the vital stuff that made possible something as small as the 0.6 inch-long Jaragua lizard&#x2014;as tiny as a raindrop&#x2014;as well as the 110-foot-long dinosaur <i>Supersaurus </i>and the 190-ton blue whale, the largest animal to have yet evolved. Stomp, fly, swim, slither, dig, run&#x2014;all are expressions of what bones make possible. But that&#x2019;s hardly all.<br> Science has a habit of reducing the complex and nuanced to the narrow and then working back up to the broader picture. That&#x2019;s part of how we construct a way of thinking about the natural world.&nbsp;&nbsp; We need constant, agreed-upon definitions in order to organize and understand. But winnowing down an observation or idea to its pur- est and most minimalistic form isn&#x2019;t always wise. John Steinbeck pointed this out long before I did. Reflecting on his time floating along the Sea of Cortez with legendary marine biologist Ed Ricketts, Steinbeck wrote that a scientist could easily look at a fish like a Mex- ican sierra and boil that animal down to measurements and notes on spine count. But that wouldn&#x2019;t really capture the whole truth of the animal. Both the quantifiable aspects of the animal and the poetic, elusive nature of its existence are needed. &#x201c;We determined to go doubly open so that in the end we could, if we wished, describe the sierra thus: &#x2018;D. XVII-15-IX, A. II-15-IX,&#x2019; but also we could see the fish alive and swimming, feel it plunge against the lines, drag it threshing over the trail, and even finally eat it.&#x201d; So it is with us, and&nbsp;our bones. We can define bone by its biochemical components, its evolutionary history, its shape and variation, but to boil down bone to numbers, measurements, or landmarks will always seem incom- plete. It doesn&#x2019;t matter whether we&#x2019;re talking about a skeleton do- nated to a museum, a skull stolen from a grave, or even a bone chip left weathering to nothing out on the ground. The truth of the bone very much depends on who&#x2019;s looking at it, and our skeletons are as embedded in our culture as they are in our bodies. Our species&nbsp;&nbsp; has made instruments and jewelry from bone, treated the dead like collector&#x2019;s items, put our faith in skull bumps as guides to human behavior, arranged skeletons into macabre tributes to the afterlife, and more.<br> While bone itself can tell our individual stories, we&#x2019;ve also woven our changing relationship with our intimate osteology into our wider history. (Osteology being the study of bones. If you see the prefix <i>osteo</i>, you know you&#x2019;re dealing with something involving skel- etons.) To borrow a term from paleontology, there is a stratigraphy of stories surrounding bone&#x2014;layer upon layer of detail that tells us who we are and where we came from. All it takes is asking the right questions.<br> That&#x2019;s where my own journey started. Dinosaurs and saber- toothed cats initially drew my attention to bone&#x2014;how could they not?&#x2014;but I wanted to let&nbsp; my&nbsp; curiosity&nbsp; approach&nbsp; humanity&nbsp; in&nbsp; the same fashion as it did my favorite petrified monsters. I had mostly ignored human bones in my research and writing&#x2014;stripped down, we just can&#x2019;t compete with the grandeur of something like <i>Stegosaurus</i>&#x2014;but my ignorance kept itching me. If I didn&#x2019;t know human skeletons, I didn&#x2019;t really know myself. I wanted to remedy that, and other skeletons had already given me a blueprint for doing so. After all, we&#x2019;re all built on the same osteological chassis with many of the same parts, inherited from a common fishy ancestor that binds vertebrates together into one great family. It follows that the same approaches to understanding other forms of vertebrate&nbsp; life can be turned onto us, too, allowing us to tease apart the layers of what our bones tell us about who we are, where we came from, and the constant identity crisis that comes part and parcel with being human. After all, we are not separate from nature but an es- pecially unusual manifestation of it. I wanted to take the same ap- proach to the bones in my body as I would the burly frame of a mastodon or the threatening bulk of an <i>Allosaurus</i>. Perhaps in doing so, I could begin to understand where I fit in among life&#x2019;s fantastic skeletal menagerie I so admire. That drive led me to the stories I&#x2019;m about to share with you.<br> What I want to do, in essence, is cut down to the bone. I have a deep affection for that osteological expression. You can be dry as a bone, be reduced to a bag of bones, pick a bone of contention, and, in exasperation, ask to be thrown a bone, for starters. But there&#x2019;s something more visceral about cutting down to the bone, slicing through to the underlying truth of something. The flesh can, and often does, lie. It&#x2019;s easily malleable stuff. Untruths spring from our squishy brains and chicanery is carried out by the push and pull of all those soft tissues. But bone remains pure, forming the ve...</p><h2>The Luck of Troy (Puffin Classics)</h2><p>Nicostratus, the son of Helen and Menelaus, grows up in Troy, where he faces a conflict of loyalties when the Greeks are about to capture the city</p><p></p><h2>When Children Grieve : For Adults to Help Children Deal With Death, Divorce, Pet Loss, Moving, and Other Losses</h2><p><p> To watch a child grieve and not know what to do is one of the most difficult experiences for parents, teachers, and caregivers. And yet, there are guidelines for helping children develop a lifelong, healthy response to loss.In When children Grieve, John W James and Russell Friedman of the Grief Recovery Institute, along with psychotherapist Dr. Leslie Landon Matthews, have created a cutting-edge volume that will help free children from the false idea that they "shouldn't feel bad" and will empower them with positive, effective methods of dealing with loss.There are many life experiences that can produce feelings of grief in a child, everything from the death of a relative or a divorce, to more everyday experiences such as moving to a new neighborhood or losing a prized possession. Whatever the reason or the degree of severity if a child you love is grieving, the guidelines examined in this thoughtful book can make a difference. For example:</p><ul><li>Listen with your heart, not your head. Allow all emotions to be expressed, without judgment, criticism, or analysis.</li><li>Recognize that grief is emotional, not intellectual. Avoid the trap of asking your child what is wrong, for he or she will automatically say "Nothing."</li><li>Adults -- Go first. Telling the truth about your own grief will make your child feel safe in opening up about his or her own feelings.</li><li>Remember that each of your children is unique and each has a unique relationship to the loss event.</li><li>Be patient. Don't force your child to talk.</li><li>Never say "Don't feel sad" or "Don't feel scared. "Sadness and fear, the two most common feelings attached to loss of any kind, are essential to being human.</li></ul></p><p>It would be a pity if this interesting, humane, and practical book were read only by parents of recently bereaved children--for two reasons. First, the book is about grief in a broad sense. Its lessons apply not only to the child whose pet, aunt, or parent has died, but also to the child whose parents have divorced, who has suffered a debilitating injury, or who has experienced other forms of traumatic loss. Second, let's face it: every child will suffer a loss at some point, so it behooves parents to be prepared in advance. As the authors say, "our task as parents is to prepare our children to deal with the experiences they will have."<p> It's unfortunate that the book has what might be considered a common structural flaw in self-help books. All of Part I (about 50 pages) is devoted to examining various myths about grieving and mistakes in dealing with it--for example, that the griever should keep busy and try not to feel bad. This is "good advice about bad advice," but it leaves the reader wondering why the authors didn't choose to get on with the plain old "good advice" on page 1. By Part II, it's already clear which coping techniques the authors will recommend. It would have been better to start there. <i>--Richard Farr</i></p><p>John W.

Lit Guild Main.</p><p>When not one but three different extremely rare diseases kill several patients at a New York hospital, forensic pathologist Jack Stapleton suspects it's more than just coincidence. He thinks there's a connection between the appearance of the mysterious microbes responsible for the deaths and the HMO that owns the hospital--the same HMO that once destroyed his flourishing medical practice. Is Americare deliberately killing off its sickest patients--those who cost the most money to treat? Or is there an even more sinister motive behind the strange goings-on at Manhattan General, not to mention the attempts on Jack's life? And what is beautiful Terese Hagen, the hard-driving creative director of a Madison Avenue ad agency, doing in the middle of this slightly muddled, but still engrossing, tale of greed, medicine, and mayhem? Like Michael Crichton, whose <i>Andromeda Strain</i> remains the classic in the genre, Cook is sometimes heavy-handed when it comes to character development, and his fulminations about the dangers of managed care often get in the way of the plot. Still, <i>Contagion</i> will make you think twice about taking your next case of flu to the ER instead of your own bed. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Dr. Robin Cook is the author of thirty previous books, most recently <em>Nano</em>, and is credited with popularizing the medical thriller with his wildly successful first novel, Coma.

Halliburton&#39;s second book, The Glorious Adventure describes his journey through the Mediterranean in the shadow of his mythical hero. In Greece, Halliburton charged Mount Olympus &#39;in order to visit the gods that dwelled there&#39;; he swam the Hellespont as Byron had before him and journeyed on to Troy, where Odysseus&#39;s long adventure began. He sailed to Stromboli in the Tyrrhenian Sea, home of Aeolus god of the winds; then to the Bay of Naples, Circeo - &#39;island&#39; of Circe - and Li Galli, the siren isles that shimmered off the Amalfi coast. Battling through the Straits of Messina, Odysseus&#39;s Scylla and Charybdis, he explored Sicily and Corfu before setting out for the shores of Ithaca, long-forgotten home for one, the end of an adventure for another. As epic and eventful as The Odyssey itself and one of the most captivating travel books of the 20th century, The Glorious Adventure evokes the romance of another time, when heroes and gods walked the earth.</p><p>Richard Halliburton (1900-1939) was America&#39;s greatest adventurer and one of the most successful adventure travel writers of the twentieth century. Through a life spent chasing horizons and concocting ever more daring schemes - from swimming the length of the Panama Canal to flying around the world in an open cockpit plane or crossing the Alps on an elephant - Halliburton dazzled the western world. His final adventure, sailing a junk across the Pacific, was also his last. Halliburton disappeared in March 1939 and was never seen again. A great and original traveller, his wild adventures live on in the books that have captivated millions of readers and inspired generations of writers.</p><h2>The Happening - Nickel Mines School Tragedy</h2><p>It was just another Monday morning, albeit an exceptionally lovely one.

She walked to school with her sister as she did every day, never suspecting that, within hours, a world that had never heard of Nickel Mines would be talking of little else. </p><p> In the days and months that followed, Rebecca Sue, her family, and her community struggled to come to grips with the tragic events of that morning. The happening had left six dead, five wounded, and thousands shocked and grieving. Somehow they had to find peace, and forgive the man who had caused their grief. </p><p> But how? </p><p> Only by the grace of God. </p><p> <i>*The author chose to tell this story, based on a true event, through the eyes of a fictitious character, Rebecca Sue. She is a compilation of the survivors of the shooting.</i></p></p><p>Harvey and his wife Karen live near the Blue Ridge Parkway in the scenic mountains of western North Carolina.

I felt compelled to respond for several reasons. First I want to say I am grateful you wrote the book to help me and probably hundreds of others put things in their right perspective. It was such a horrible event and so senseless. It is so easy to be angry and lash out...I wanted to say that I loved the way you wrote the book. While the point of the story was to understand the tragedy, I was relieved that the focus of the book was not on the specifics of the trauma itself and reliving the horrific events with graphic details. The story was told of the emotion behind every person, no matter who they were, and how they were involved. By the end of the book, it would almost be next to impossible to be angry for what happened. --Nancy<br><br>I just finished reading <i>The Happening</i> and want to say thank you for being led by God in writing this book. Although it is a <i>tough read</i> it is a <i>must read</i>. I say <i>tough read</i> because I had to stop at least a half dozen times to wipe the tears from my eyes. It is a <i>must read</i> because the world needs to be exposed to the theme of forgiveness that is so eloquently intertwined throughout the book. I live about a 15 minute drive from where this tragedy occured. Reading the book reminded me that we must continue to keep the hundreds of people and especially the Amish families in our prayers. Even though more than a year has gone by, it will surely take many years, if not a lifetime, for some to fully recover. The book will also certainly lead to the salvation of many who read it and that in itself brings purpose to God's plan in allowing this tragedy to occur. May He receive all the glory and honor, and may the name of Jesus Christ be exalted. --Fred<br><br><i>The Happening</i> is the most inspiring book I have ever read! --T.L.

Self-publishing and the Internet have given rise to new, autobiographical forms and an increasing number of authors draw from outside the mainstream, whether sexually, ethnically, or politically.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this richly illustrated and accessible survey, acclaimed author Paul Gravett considers the vast output of comics culture from the late 19th century to today, including syndicated comics, graphic novels, and contemporary art and illustration. From foundational masterpieces such as Rodolphe Topffer&#x2019;s and Wilhelm Busch&#x2019;s albums, George McManus&#x2019;s Art Deco &#x201c;Bringing Up Father,&#x201d; and Alex Raymond&#x2019;s &#x201c;Flash Gordon&#x201d; to the later retro stylings of Robert Crumb, Gravett considers lines of influence from around the world and examines how comics have shifted from supporting the status quo to becoming the voice of alternative subcultures. Gravett traces the major themes taking place in contemporary comics, noting the rise of publications that function as questioning, transgressive outlets for outsider stories and ideas, and includes the ways that folk art traditions are reinvigorating the form.</p><p>In this fascinating survey, acclaimed author Paul Gravett considers the vast output of comics culture from the late 19th century to today, tracing international lines of influence and examining major themes in contemporary comics.<br><b>Paul Gravett</b> is a London-based freelance writer and curator who has worked in comics publishing and promotion since 1981.

Between the clotheslines, three cottages were still inhabited. Three old women still tended gardens and made soup and dusted&#x2014;once a month&#x2014;the trinkets of those killed. Once a month, they made their way through empty houses, empty streets, empty stores, empty churches. Once a month, they spoke the names of the dead.</p><p>The composer surprised the three women by speaking their dialect, knowing their words for <i>spoon</i> and <i>daffodil</i> and <i>hat</i>. At first they feared he&#x2019;d been sent by the dictator as a spy&#x2014;yet who but the son of a native son would know the story of the leaf child, the rhyme about the wolf maiden?</p><p>He lived with them a week and recorded (this had been his purpose) their songs, of which they were the world&#x2019;s last three singers. A song of lamentation, a song of mourning, a song of protest and despair. They had forgotten the song for weddings.</p><p>Back safe across the border, the composer set scores around the songs, made records of string instruments wailing behind the women&#x2019;s voices. He was fulfilled: He had preserved, before its last breath, their culture.</p><p>When the dictator learned of the record, he became enraged. Not over the songs (what was a lamentation, to a dictator?) but over the evidence of life in a village he had been assured was wiped out in its entirety.</p><p>One October morning, he sent his men to finish the job.</p><p>(But I&#x2019;ve made it sound like a fable, haven&#x2019;t I? I&#x2019;ve lied and turned two women into three, because three is a fairy tale number.)</p><p></p><p></p><p>THE WORST YOU EVER FEEL</p><p>When the nine-fingered violinist finally began playing, Aaron hid high up on the wooden staircase, as far above the party as the ghosts. He was a spider reigning over the web of oriental rug, that burst of red and black and gold, and from his spider limbs stretched invisible fibers, winding light and sticky around the forty guests, around his parents, around Radelescu the violinist. There were thinner strands, too, between people who had a history together of love or hate, and all three ghosts were tied to Radelescu, to his arcing bow. But Aaron held the thickest strings, and when he thought, <i>breathe</i>, all the people breathed.</p><p>After dinner, his mother had not nodded him up to his toothpaste and away from the drunken conversations as she had when he was nine, ten, eleven, and Aaron wondered whether she&#x2019;d forgotten in the wine and noise, or whether this was something new, something he could expect from now on. To be safe he&#x2019;d changed to pajama pants and a white T-shirt, so he could claim he&#x2019;d come down for water. He remembered to muss his hair, staticky enough on its own but now a halo of rough brown in the bedroom mirror. Through the balusters, he watched the man and his violin duck in and out of the yellow cone of light that fell from the lamp above the piano. Yesterday morning, Aaron&#x2019;s mother had brought Radelescu a plate of scrambled eggs with parsley and toast as he sat at the bench, slowly picking out the chords of the accompaniment and marking the score. Tonight, she played the accompaniment for him.</p><p>Aaron guessed that by moving in and out of the light, Radelescu was blinding himself to the room, to the eager faces and cradled wineglasses of the greedy listeners. Now, as the old man began to play faster, Aaron felt tired, and he needed the bathroom, but he didn&#x2019;t want to move himself from the wooden step and away from the music. His throat had been sore all day, glue and needles, but now he was able to forget that. He squinted to see the stump of Radelescu&#x2019;s chopped-off finger, to see if he held the bow differently than other people, but the arm moved too fast.</p><p>Behind Radelescu, leaning against the fireplace, Aaron&#x2019;s father rolled the cup of his empty wineglass back and forth between his hands, eyes closed. Aaron&#x2019;s father was the luckiest man in the world. Exhibit A: He&#x2019;d been rescued from drowning three different times. Exhibit B: The third time was by an American pianist much younger than he was, a woman so beautiful he married her and she became Aaron&#x2019;s mother. Exhibit C: He left the university, and Ia&#x15f;i, and Moldavia, and all of Romania on June 20, 1941, nine days before the start of the Ia&#x15f;i pogrom. Exhibit D: He left because he had won a scholarship to Juilliard and it took a long time to cross the ocean in an ocean liner, especially in the uncertain time of war, and once you&#x2019;ve gone to Juilliard you have connections, and connections are what matter in life, even more than talent.</p><p>Aaron could not hear much difference between this music and that on Radelescu&#x2019;s last record, the one from 1966 with no cover. The man had aged twenty-four years since then, and this perhaps accounted for the small moments of shakiness, the vibratos that warbled on the far side of control. He was old. The hair stuck out from his head in white, wavy lines. The wrinkles on his face were carved deep, and the ones across his forehead were as wavy as his hair. Radelescu spoke only a little English, and Aaron spoke no Romanian at all, so at dinner the night before, Aaron and his mother had sat quietly while the two men spoke. Occasionally, Aaron&#x2019;s father would translate something for them, but it was only about the concert preparations or the delicious food. Later, when Radelescu overheard Aaron talking to his mother about the book report due Monday, the old man began to laugh. Aaron&#x2019;s father translated that he was amused to hear a child speak English so quickly and so fluently. And so all day today, Aaron had tried to speak faster and louder and use longer words. &#x201c;Pathetic,&#x201d; he had said at lunch, and &#x201c;electrocution&#x201d; and &#x201c;cylinder.&#x201d; When Radelescu asked to borrow Aaron&#x2019;s rosin for his own bow, Aaron had said, &#x201c;Indubitably.&#x201d;</p><p>In the afternoon, Aaron had gone with the two men to the Jewel-Osco. He assumed they were there to pick up some last things for the party, but then they simply went and stood in the middle of the produce section. They stood a long time by the bins of different apples, pointing at mushrooms and grapefruits and bananas and speaking Romanian. Radelescu was happy, but there was something else on his face, too, and Aaron tried to read it. Devastation, maybe. When a lady passed with her plastic basket, Aaron pretended to investigate the tomato display. Finally they got a cart and began to walk through the aisles, grabbing olive oil, seltzer, five kinds of cheese. They returned to the produce section, where Aaron&#x2019;s father put five bunches of green onions in the cart and handed Radelescu a bright tangerine. Radelescu said something, laughed&#x2014;and then, pressing his mouth to the orange skin, kissed the fruit.</p><p>Aaron could feel now that the people in the room below were breathing less, as if afraid to propel the old man back to Romania on the wind of their exhalations.</p><p>And no, he could not actually see the three ghosts with their violins&#x2014;the three students who died in 1941&#x2014;but he knew where they would be and he traced their flight with his eyes, over the crowd, around the light, against the ceiling. Until he was ten, whenever Aaron was sick or bleeding, his father would say the same thing: &#x201c;May this be the worst pain you ever feel.&#x201d; By which he meant: &#x201c;This is nothing. American boys will never receive thin-papered letters by airmail that their mother, father, two sisters, one brother, grandparents, uncles and aunts, thirteen cousins, have all been killed. You do not know suffering.&#x201d;</p><p>But that changed two years ago, when they all went to West Germany before his father&#x2019;s concert in Bonn. It was the closest Aaron had ever been to Romania, though now that things were suddenly different his father promised a trip before the year was out. As they pulled their luggage through the streets of Bonn, jet-lagged, Aaron had felt a spook, a chill, something that made him want to run, and, half-asleep, almost dreaming, he dropped his backpack to break off around the corner and down an alley until he came to a kind of park. He couldn&#x2019;t feel his legs. He had run toward the chill, he realized, not away from it. He did not picture dead bodies, he did not see ghosts or hear voices, but he felt something terrible and haunted, the skin-crawl of being alone in a house and pressing your back to the wall so nothing can get behind you. When his father caught him hard by the arm and asked what he was doing, Aaron said, &#x201c;This is where all the people died.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t mean it, didn&#x2019;t believe it, but these words were the only way he could express his strange nausea, the feeling that he was surrounded by graves. His eyes must have looked scared and honest enough, because when they finally found the hotel, his mother asked the old, long-nosed concierge the history of the square. &#x201c;Yes, yes, there was a synagogue,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;A terrible massacre. This is 1096, almost a thousand years.&#x201d; And his parents looked at each other, and his father said something in German to the concierge, and his mother&#x2019;s face became lighter than her hair. Aaron was as shocked as his parents, and he spent the rest of the trip wondering whether this was luck, maybe inherited from his father, or a real vision he just hadn&#x2019;t known enough to trust fully.</p><p>He tried every day now to focus on the things he felt but couldn&#x2019;t see. It made him even odder to his classmates, he knew, the way he&#x2019;d sometimes close his eyes in history class, concentrating. He tried to sit in the back row whenever he could. It was people&#x2019;s sadness, mostly, that he attempted to feel, the ghosts that surrounded them, the place where a finger used to be but no longer was. He imagined pain traveling through the air on radio waves. If he positioned himself in a room and concentrated and listened, he could catch it all.</p><p>Since then, his father had not belittled his fevers or broken bones. Aaron knew his father suspected that he was haunted, that he saw ghosts and fires and the evils of the world, past, present, future. He would ask Aaron sometimes what he was thinking, wait for the answer with squeezed eyebrows. He would sit by his bed on nights Aaron couldn&#x2019;t sleep.</p><p>But Aaron was half a liar. When he felt something&#x2014;for instance, that a woman on the train was sick&#x2014;he wouldn&#x2019;t say it aloud until later, when there was no way his parents could ask if she needed help. It was something his mother would probably do, go up to a stranger like that. Most times, he never found out himself whether he was right or wrong. And he didn&#x2019;t want to know, because if he were wrong even once or twice he&#x2019;d stop trusting himself. For the same reason, when his father asked him for lottery numbers, he just shook his head. &#x201c;But think!&#x201d; his father would say. &#x201c;With my luck and your psychic powers!&#x201d; It was the only time he joked about it. When he told the story of Bonn at parties, as he had tonight, it was with reverence. He called Aaron &#x201c;our little rabbi,&#x201d; but he wasn&#x2019;t poking fun.</p><p>The six best things about parties were: (1) having so many people to spy on; (2) the job of opening the door for guests and waiting for the curbs to fill with parked cars until yours was the house everyone passed and said, &#x201c;Oh, they must be having a party tonight!&#x201d; (3) pastries; (4) the old Romanian men who always brought chocolates, including ones filled with coconut; (5) watching people get drunk and seeing if any ladies tripped in their high heels; and (6) the music.</p><p>Radelescu stopped, and people clapped. Aaron decided to pay more attention to the next piece, to follow the music itself rather than what it made him think of. This might be impossible, he knew, to hear only the notes and not daydream or invent pictures. Aaron owed the habit to his first violin teacher, Mrs. Takebe, who insisted that every piece tells a story. As he practiced, he invented quite elaborate ones: One sonata was about a Chinese spy. Another told of a man who had lost his wife in an art gallery and spent the rest of his life looking for her hidden in the paintings.</p><p>Aaron knew that no one in the room, least of all himself, could listen without dwelling on Radelescu&#x2019;s missing finger, on how he&#x2019;d almost starved to death, on how he&#x2019;d kept his arms strong in prison. And so a minute in, he gave up focusing on the music alone. Instead he willed himself to feel, more than anyone else in the room, the old man&#x2019;s memory. <i>This piece will tell the story of his life</i>, he decided, and he tried to understand each note as a separate moment, to hear the thoughts Radelescu himself pulled into them.</p><p>Aaron&#x2019;s father had told him about the university in Ia&#x15f;i, the oldest in Romania, where the young Radelescu had taught only two semesters before quitting in a rage, setting up his own studio in a decrepit two-story building behind campus. He&#x2019;d brought many students with him, including Aaron&#x2019;s father, who secretly left the university grounds for lessons three times a week. Soon a piano teacher joined him, and the place was full of music. Wherever in the thin-walled building you took your violin, you could still hear the piano. And so the two teachers began to specialize in duets, because what else could you do? Aaron imagined that the building smelled old, that mildewed rugs covered the floors, but that the piano was impeccably tuned. His father had always spoken of the two teachers in one breath: Radelescu and Morgenstern and their famous music factory. Morgenstern, he said, had fingers like tree branches and legs like a stick insect&#x2019;s. When he reached for notes, the piano looked as small as a child&#x2019;s tin keyboard. Next to Radelescu&#x2019;s old records on the shelves were several of Morgenstern&#x2019;s: 1965, 1972, 1980, 1986. Aaron liked flipping through the jackets in chronological order to watch the man&#x2019;s hair go from brown to gray to white and to see his jowls slowly drop.</p><p>The music factory&#x2019;s star violin student had been Aaron&#x2019;s father, and on the last day before he set off for America, they&#x2019;d had a party with a small cake. They must have known there was danger around them. There had been pogroms in other Romanian towns. Aaron imagined a stack of newspapers sitting on the lid of the piano, largely ignored. They might have put the little cake right on top of the papers. They might have said, &#x201c;Be careful on your journey.&#x201d; No one would need to say why.</p><p>The piece ended&#x2014;softly&#x2014;before Aaron could continue the story. No one clapped this time. They sighed and nodded and closed their eyes. Aaron hoped the next piece would be full of noise and minor keys so he could feel how Ia&#x15f;i had turned on itself, how the Iron Guard had rampaged for nine days through the town, finding every Jew. It was worse than Nazis, because these were people they had trusted. Some of Radelescu&#x2019;s old students would have been among them. Aaron could not picture the Guard without imagining men in suits of armor, even though his father had corrected this notion long ago.</p><p>But the next piece was quiet and tense, and so instead Aaron imagined the inside of the music school, where, when the pogrom began, Radelescu, Morgenstern, and six students barricaded themselves. Four of the students were Jewish. Both teachers were. Around him in the room, Aaron felt the swaying of the forty-two people who were not Radelescu, and he felt them try to imagine his time...</p></p><h2>Ghosthunting North Carolina (America&#39;s Haunted Road Trip)</h2><p>Journey with author <b>Kala Ambrose</b> as she explores the most terrifying paranormal spots in the state of North Carolina.

Originally it was referred to as Tawboro, taw being a Native American word referring to the river of health. <br>My favorite part of Tarboro is the historic area, which is a 45-block district with more than 300 residential homes, historic churches, and many nineteenth-century buildings still stand-ing and in use. Tarboro also has a 15-acre park with war memori-als and a town common. <br>I visited Tarboro in 2010, as the town celebrated its 250th anniversary. The celebration included a variety of events based on the town s history. Driving around the Tarboro historic com-mons, one senses how ripe it must be for ghostly activity. In 1863, 800 Union soldiers engaged in a five-day attack on Green-ville, Tarboro, and Rocky Mount, destroying steamboats and supplies in Tarboro. As we ve already seen in these investiga-tions, the Civil War made its mark across North Carolina, and many ghosts remain to tell the tale. <br>In the historic district is the Blount-Bridgers House, a Fed-eral-style plantation home built in 1808 by Thomas Blount. Blount built the plantation, originally called the Grove, on 296 acres of land. Throughout the years, the house seemed to wel-come and favor military men. Thomas Blount lived in the home from 1808 to 1812, Col. Louis Dicken Wilson lived there from 1831 to 1847, and Col. John Bridgers lived in the home from 1850 to 1880. During the American Revolution, many of the locals fought valiantly in the war, including Thomas Blount, who became a prisoner of war in England. He was eventually freed and returned to North Carolina to help create one of the largest ship-ping companies in the late eighteenth century and later served in the U.S. House of Representatives. Colonel Wilson served in the North Carolina Senate and fought in the Mexican-American War, and Colonel Bridgers is best known for his service as a commandant in the Civil War, where he served at Fort Macon. <br>The Blount-Bridgers House served as a public library and a dance studio before it was turned into a museum in 1979. It fea-tures a nice collection of nineteenth-century furniture along with the art collection of Tarboro-born Hobson Pittman. The home is welcoming with wraparound porches, which I love; I could spend an afternoon here just relaxing and chatting on the porch. While taking the tour of the Blount-Bridgers House, we were guided to two areas of the home where a female ghost has been seen and felt by visitors and staff. Many presume the ghost to be Jackie Blount, and she is most often seen in the parlor and the art room displaying Hobson Pittman s art. Apparently a lady of good taste and breeding, she has a love and appreciation of art and likes to show her Southern hospitality by greeting guests who visit her home. <br>During my research and conversations with local residents, I learned that the ghost, Jackie (Mary Jacqueline Sumner Blount), was the wife of Thomas Blount and part of the Sumner fam-ily connected to the Mordecai House in Raleigh. I write more about the Mordecai House in the Central Carolina section of this book, as it is also haunted. This led me to wonder: Do ghosts visit all of their fam-ily homes and haunts, much as they used to travel back then between their winter and summer homes? Could the ghosts of the Blount-Bridgers House also be haunting the Mordecai House? Did Jackie still spend time between the two cities, com-ing and going according to social occasions in spirit, and was John Bridgers enjoying the Blount-Bridgers home in the after-life while also spending time checking on his troops at Fort Macon, which is also haunted? <br>Most likely, we ll never know for sure, though it is interesting to ponder. I also find it fascinating that the more I travel and inves-tigate throughout the state, the more connections I find between haunted areas, historic sites, and family trees. Some people leave such an impression by their lives that their presence continues to be felt in every location where they lived, fought, and loved. <br>While visiting Tarboro, I also learned about the gravesite of Civil War Gen. William Dorsey Pender, who is buried in Cal-vary Churchyard in Tarboro. He was fatally wounded during the Battle of Gettysburg. Many locals say that his ghost is still around today and has been seen in both the church graveyard and in the town commons area. He s reported to be cordial and a true Southern gentleman. What I found most romantic about his story is that the letters that the general wrote to his wife were collected and published almost 100 years after his death in a book titled, The General to His Lady: The Civil War Letters of William Dorsey Pender to Fanny Pender. <br>When I travel to towns, I generally get a feeling about the area and how it s doing economically, emotionally, and otherwise. My feeling about Tarboro is that it s on its way up, and about to experience a renaissance and period of new growth and expansion. History in the making is occurring in Tarboro, and the local ghosts couldn t be more pleased. <br>"<br>"It's a gem for any traveler interested in ghost hunting or history." -- "The Robesonian" June 2012 <br>"As usual, Ambrose makes learning the history of this fabled state fascinating.

When Arizona Territory was America's last frontier, this area was homesteaded by Anglo and Mexican settlers alike, who often displaced the Indian population that had lived there for centuries. This frontier way of life, which prevailed as recently as the beginning of the twentieth century, is now recollected in vivid detail by an octogenarian who spent her girlhood in this beautiful, cruel country. Eva Antonia Wilbur inherited a unique affinity for the land. Granddaughter of a Harvard-educated physician who came to the Territory in the 1860s, she was the firstborn child of a Mexican mother and Anglo father who instilled in her an appreciation for both cultures. Little To�a learned firsthand the responsibilities of ranching&#x2014;an education usually reserved for boys&#x2014;and also experienced the racial hostility that occurred during those final years before the Papago Indians were confined to a reservation. Begun as a reminiscence to tell younger family members about their "rawhide tough and lonely" life at the turn of the century, Mrs. Wilbur-Cruce's book is rich with imagery and dialogue that brings the Arivaca area to life. Her story is built around the annual cycle of ranch life&#x2014;its spring and fall round-ups, planting and harvesting&#x2014;and features a cavalcade of border characters, anecdotes about folk medicine, and recollections of events that were most meaningful in a young girl's life. Her account constitutes a valuable primary source from a region about which nothing similar has been previously published, while the richness of her story creates a work of literature that will appeal to readers of all ages.</p><p>"At the age of 5, in 1909, the author could herd livestock, tame a bronco and brand a cow. . . . How fortunate that she gave us this flavorful memoir of that year, documenting a now vanished way of life on the territorial frontier." &#x2014;<i>New York Times</i>"The book sits on the cusp of culture and time. . . . a fascinating account of frontier life." &#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times</i>"A most captivating and readable piece of personal history." &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i>"There are books that are constructed&#x2014;and there are books that are lived. What immediately draws the reader to <i>A Beautiful, Cruel Country</i> is this sense of living history, of the author's immersion in the land of her childhood." &#x2014;<i>Western American Literature</i>"As fascinating and diversified as the contents of an old trunk . . . [a] most interesting and appealing book." &#x2014;<i>Western Historical Quarterly</i>"Transitory wisps of beauty, rose-petal desert sunset clouds, or a golden lace banner of butterflies floating in midair made a deep, long-lasting impression." &#x2014;<i>The Bloomsbury Review</i></p><h2>All You Ever Need</h2><p><p>Imagine a land so dry that every drop of rain is like pure gold. And in the middle of this arid land there is a village filled with people who need more than just a few buckets of rainwater to survive. Fortunately for them, Tobias lives nearby. He owns the only wellspring in the desert, and it pours forth clear, cool water&#x2014;water he and his son happily give to everyone who asks. He is lovingly called the Watermaster, and he believes that the water should be a free gift to all.</p> <p>But when the Watermaster goes on an unexpected journey, the people realize in a whole new way the amazing gift he's been giving them. The only gift they really need.</p> <p>God's grace is a gift more precious than water in a desert. It is all you and your children ever need. As our bodies cannot live without water, so our souls cannot truly live without God's grace. It is by His grace alone that we can come to Him and ask for the Living Water, which is eternal life. His grace poured out at Calvary cleanses our hearts and souls. So marvelous and matchless is this gift&#x2014;a gift we do not deserve, a gift we cannot buy or earn&#x2014;yet we need only ask and believe.</p> <p>This poignant tale, first told in the popular Crossway book <em>Tell Me the Secrets,</em> and its rich illustrations uniquely capture the wonder of God's amazing grace. Let it help you share this vital truth with your children, that they may know the real Watermaster and receive His Living Water.</p></p><p><p><strong>Max Lucado</strong> is a best-selling inspirational author and speaker, and a minister of preaching at Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, Texas.

The battle begins in a fifty-million-franc game of baccarat, gains momentum during Bond&#x2019;s fiery love affair with a sensuous lady spy, and reaches a chilling climax with fiendish torture at the hands of a master sadist. For incredible suspense, unexpected thrills, and extraordinary danger, nothing can beat James Bond in his inaugural adventure.</p><p><b>Ian Fleming</b> (1908&#x2013;1964), creator of the world&#x2019;s best-known secret agent, is the author of fifteen James Bond novels. He joined Naval Intelligence and served throughout World War II, finally earning the rank of commander. Much of the James Bond material was drawn directly from Fleming&#x2019;s experiences as an intelligence officer.<p><b>1. THE SECRET AGENT</b></p> <p>The scent and smoke and sweat of a casino are nauseating at three in the morning. Then the soul-erosion produced by high gambling&#x2014;a compost of greed and fear and nervous tension&#x2014;becomes unbearable and the senses awake and revolt from it.</p> <p>James Bond suddenly knew that he was tired. He always knew when his body or his mind had had enough and he always acted on the knowledge. This helped him to avoid staleness and the sensual bluntness that breeds mistakes.</p> <p>He shifted himself unobtrusively away from the roulette he had been playing and went to stand for a moment at the brass rail which surrounded breast-high the top table in the salle privee.</p> <p>Le Chiffre was still playing and still, apparently, winning. There was an untidy pile of flecked hundred-mille plaques in front of him. In the shadow of his thick left arm there nestled a discreet stack of the big yellow ones worth half a million francs each.</p> <p>Bond watched the curious, impressive profile for a time, and then he shrugged his shoulders to lighten his thoughts and moved away.</p> <p>The barrier surrounding the caisse comes as high as your chin and the caissier, who is generally nothing more than a minor bank clerk, sits on a stool and dips into his piles of notes and plaques. These are ranged on shelves. They are on a level, behind the protecting barrier, with your groin. The caissier has a cosh and a gun to protect him, and to heave over the barrier and steal some notes and then vault back and get out of the casino through the passages and doors would be impossible. And the caissiers generally work in pairs.</p> <p>Bond reflected on the problem as he collected the sheaf of hundred thousand and then the sheaves often thousand franc notes. With another part of his mind, he had a vision of tomorrow's regular morning meeting of the casino committee.</p> <p>'Monsieur Le Chiffre made two million. He played his usual game. Miss Fairchild made a million in an hour and then left. She executed three "bancos" of Monsieur Le Chiffre within an hour and then left. She played with coolness. Monsieur le Vicomte de Villorin made one million two at roulette. He was playing the maximum on the first and last dozens. He was lucky. Then the Englishman, Mister Bond, increased his winnings to exactly three million over the two days. He was playing a progressive system on red at table five. Duclos, the chef de partie, has the details. It seems that he is persevering and plays in maximums. He has luck. His nerves seem good. On the soiree, the chemin-de-fer won x, the baccarat won y and the roulette won z. The boule, which was again badly frequented, still makes its expenses.'</p> <p>'Merci, Monsieur Xavier.'</p> <p>'Merci, Monsieur le President.'</p> <p>Or something like that, thought Bond as he pushed his way through the swing doors of the salle privee and nodded to the bored man in evening clothes whose job it is to bar your entry and your exit with the electric foot-switch which can lock the doors at any hint of trouble.</p> <p>And the casino committee would balance its books and break up to its homes or cafes for lunch.</p> <p>As for robbing the caisse, in which Bond himself was not personally concerned, but only interested, he reflected that it would take ten good men, that they would certainly have to kill one or two employees, and that anyway you probably couldn't find ten non-squeal killers in France, or in any other country for the matter of that.</p> <p>As he gave a thousand francs to the vestiaire and walked down the steps of the casino. Bond made up his mind that Le Chiffre would in no circumstances try to rob the caisse and he put the contingency out of his mind. Instead he explored his present physical sensations. He felt the dry, uncomfortable gravel under his evening shoes, the bad, harsh taste in his mouth and the slight sweat under his arms. He could feel his eyes filling their sockets. The front of his face, his nose and antrum, were congested. He breathed the sweet night air deeply and focused his senses and his wits. He wanted to know if anyone had searched his room since he had left it before dinner.</p> <p>He walked across the broad boulevard and through the gardens to the Hotel Splendide. He smiled at the concierge who gave him his key&#x2014;No 45 on the first floor&#x2014;and took the cable.</p> <p>It was from Jamaica and read:</p> <p>KINGSTONJA XXXX XXXXXX XXXX XXX<br> BOND SPLENDIDE ROYALE-LES-EAUX SEINE<br> INFERIEURE HAVANA CIGAR PRODUCTION ALL<br> CUBAN FACTORIES 1915 TEN MILLION REPEAT<br> TEN MILLION STOP HOPE THIS FIGURE YOU<br> REQUIRE REGARDS.<br> </p> <p>DASILVA<br> </p> <p>This meant that ten million francs was on the way to him. It was the reply to a request Bond had sent that afternoon through Paris to his headquarters in London asking for more funds. Paris had spoken to London where Clements, the head of Bond's department, had spoken to M, who had smiled wryly and told 'The Broker' to fix it with the Treasury.</p> <p>Bond had once worked in Jamaica and his cover on the Royale assignment was that of a very rich client of Messrs Caffery, the principal import and export firm of Jamaica. So he was being controlled through Jamaica, through a taciturn man who was head of the picture desk on the Daily Gleaner, the famous newspaper of the Caribbean.</p> <p>This man on the Gleaner, whose name was Fawcett, had been bookkeeper for one of the leading turtle fisheries on the Cayman Islands. One of the men from the Caymans who had volunteered on the outbreak of war, he had ended up as a Paymaster's clerk in a small Naval Intelligence organization in Malta. At the end of the war, when, with a heavy heart, he was due to return to the Caymans, he was spotted by the section of the Secret Service concerned with the Caribbean. He was strenuously trained in photography and in some other arts and, with the quiet connivance of an influential man in Jamaica, found his way to the picture desk of the Gleaner.</p> <p>In the intervals between sifting photographs submitted by the great agencies&#x2014;Keystone, Wide-World, Universal, INP, and Reuter-Photo&#x2014;he would get peremptory instructions by telephone from a man he had never met to carry out certain simple operations 1 requiring nothing but absolute discretion, speed, and accuracy. For these occasional services he received twenty pounds a month paid into his account with the Royal Bank of Canada by a fictitious relative in England.</p> <p>Fawcett's present assignment was to relay immediately to Bond, full rates, the text of messages which he received at home by telephone from his anonymous contact. He had been told by this contact that nothing he would be asked to send would arouse the suspicion of the Jamaican post office. So he was not surprised to find himself suddenly appointed string correspondent for the 'Maritime Press and Photo Agency', with press-collect facilities to France and England, on a further monthly retainer of ten pounds.</p> <p>He felt secure and encouraged, had visions of a BEM and made the first payment on a Morris Minor. He also bought a green eye-shade which he had long coveted and which helped him to impose his personality on the picture desk.</p> <p>Some of this background to his cable passed through Bond's mind. He was used to oblique control and rather liked it. He felt it feather-bedded him a little, allowed him to give or take an hour or two in his communications with M. He knew that this was probably a fallacy, that probably there was another member of the Service at Royale-les-Eaux who was reporting independently, but it did give the illusion that he wasn't only 150 miles across the Channel from that deadly office building near Regent's Park, being watched and judged by those few cold brains that made the whole show work. Just as Fawcett, the Cayman Islander in Kingston, knew that if he bought that Morris Minor outright instead of signing the hire-purchase agreement, someone in London would probably know and want to know where the money had come from.</p> <p>Bond read the cable twice. He tore a telegram form off the pad on the desk (why give them carbon copies?) and wrote his reply in capital letters:</p> <p>THANKS INFORMATION SHOULD SUFFICE&#x2014;BOND</p> <p>He handed this to the concierge and put the cable signed 'Dasilva' in his pocket. The employers (if any) of the concierge could bribe a copy out of the local post office, if the concierge hadn't already steamed the envelope open or read the cable upside down in Bond's hands.</p> <p>He took his key and said good night and turned to the stairs, shaking his head at the liftman. Bond knew what an obliging danger-signal a lift could be. He didn't expect anyone to be moving on the first floor, but he preferred to be prudent.</p> <p>Walking quietly up on the balls of his feet, he regretted the hubris of his reply to M via Jamaica. As a gambler he knew it was a mistake to rely on too small a capital. Anyway, M probably wouldn't let him have any more. He shrugged his shoulders and turned off the stairs into the corridor and walked softly to the door of his room.</p> <p>Bond knew exactly where the switch was and it was with one flow of motion that he stood on the threshold with the door full open, the light on and a gun in his hand. The safe, empty room sneered at him. He ignored the half-open door of the bathroom and, locking himself in, he turned up the bed-light and the mirror-light and threw his gun on the settee beside the window. Then he bent down and inspected one of his own black hairs which still lay undisturbed where he had left it before dinner, wedged into the drawer of the writing-desk.</p> <p>Next he examined a faint trace of talcum powder on the inner rim of the porcelain handle of the clothes cupboard. It appeared immaculate. He went into the bathroom, lifted the cover of the lavatory cistern and verified the level of the water against a small scratch on the copper ball-cock.</p> <p>Doing all this, inspecting these minute burglar alarms, did not make him feel foolish or self-conscious. He was a secret agent, an...</p></p><h2>Choice Cuts: A Savory Selection of Food Writing from Around the World and Throughout History</h2><p>&#x201c;Every once in awhile a writer of particular skills takes a fresh, seemingly improbable idea and turns out a book of pure delight.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s how David McCullough described Mark Kurlansky&#x2019;s <i>Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World</i>, a work that revealed how a meal can be as important as it is edible. <i>Salt: A World History</i>, its successor, did the same for a seasoning, and confirmed Kurlansky as one of our most erudite and entertaining food authors. Now, the winner of the James Beard Award for Excellence in Food Writing shares a varied selection of &#x201c;choice cuts&#x201d; by others, as he leads us on a mouthwatering culinary tour around the world and through history and culture from the fifth century B.C. to the present day.<br><br><i>Choice Cuts</i> features more than two hundred pieces, from Cato to Cab Calloway. Here are essays by Plato on the art of cooking . . . Pablo Neruda on french fries . . . Alice B. Toklas on killing a carp . . . M. F. K. Fisher on the virility of Turkish desserts . . . Alexandre Dumas on coffee . . . W. H. Auden on Icelandic food . . . Elizabeth David on the downward march of English pizza . . . Claude L�vi-Strauss on &#x201c;the idea of rotten&#x201d; . . . James Beard on scrambled eggs . . . Balzac, Virginia Woolf, E. M. Forster, Chekhov, and many other famous gourmands and gourmets, accomplished cooks, or just plain ravenous writers on the passions of cuisine.</p><p>"Food is about agriculture, about ecology, about man's relationship with nature ... about nation-building, cultural struggles, friends and enemies ... and at times, even about sex." Thus Mark Kurlansky, author of the award-winning <i>Cod</i> and <i>Salt</i>, introduces <i>Choice Cuts</i>, his anthology of food writing throughout history. Kurlansky has cast his net very wide and presents a legion of food writers on every possible culinary subject.<p>The usual suspects are here, sometimes in triplicate: Brilliat Savarin on gourmets, female food-love, and how to gain weight; M.F.K. Fisher on bachelor cooking, the dislike of cabbage, and dinner at France's famed Monsieur Paul's in the 1940s; Elizabeth David on the folly of the garlic press, the glories of toast, and English pizza. But Kurlansky's trail starts much earlier with Plato on cooking (food as a branch of medicine, a notion shared by many modern advertisers), Heroditus on Egyptian dining, and, resoundingly, Mencius, a student of Confucius who, in the third century B.C., implored Chinese leaders to observe saner food and environmental policies.</p><p>There is a great deal to digest here, but readers can take small bites at their leisure.

As a young man, he founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood with Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Holman Hunt. In later years, he rose to wealth, acclaim, and social prestige as a landscapist, illustrator, and painter of subject and genre pictures and as the most successful British portrait painter of his generation. This lavishly illustrated book, published to accompany a major exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in London, is the first comprehensive survey of Millais's portraits. It is also a historically important record of High Victorian England, containing the artist's memorable images of such leading political and cultural figures as Gladstone, Disraeli, Tennyson, Ruskin, Carlyle, and Lillie Langtry. The book includes 100 color reproductions as well as essays by eminent scholars that place Millais's work in the context of his public and private life, making this an authoritative and visually compelling study of the artist's extraordinary contributions to portraiture.</p><br><p>Peter Funnell begins the book by describing Millais's astonishing popularity and the artist's public persona, examining his practice as a portraitist and assessing the view common among later critics that Millais's mature work failed to fulfill his youthful promise. Leon�e Ormond examines Millais's early portraits, from his precocious boyhood sketches to his magnificent portrait of Ruskin (1853-54) and his paintings of Ruskin's wife, Effie, who famously left her husband to marry Millais. Malcolm Warner interprets Millais's portraits of children--including the elegiac painting <i>Autumn Leaves</i> (1855-56) and the melancholy <i>Nina Lehmann</i> (1869)--as reflections of Millais's nostalgic ideas about the naturalness, innocence, and beauty of childhood. H. C. G. Matthew assesses Millais's portraits of men of power, which include paintings of four Prime Ministers (Gladstone, Disraeli, Salisbury, and Rosebery). Kate Flint discusses Millais's portraits of women, which ranged from likenesses of family and friends to glamorous paintings of the rich, aristocratic, and beautiful. Each essay is followed by its own thematic catalogue of portraits.</p><br><p>The elegantly written essays and stunning reproductions are supplemented by Warner's extensive documentation about individual works of art, drawings from Millais's sketchbooks, and photographs of the artist in his studio. In its words and images, in its scholarship and its accessibility to the general reader, this is an exceptional book about one of the most influential artists of the nineteenth century.</p></p><p><b>Peter Funnell</b> is Curator of the Nineteenth-Century Collection at the National Portrait Gallery.

As in <i>Silence</i>, the pulse-pounding suspense plot involves a hypersensitive FBI sleuth who consults psycho psychiatrist Lecter for clues to catching a killer on the loose.<p> The sleuth, Will Graham, actually quit the FBI after nearly getting killed by Lecter while nabbing him, but fear isn't what bugs him about crime busting. It's just too creepy to get inside a killer's twisted mind. But he comes back to stop a madman who's been butchering entire families. The FBI needs Graham's insight, and Graham needs Lecter's genius. But Lecter is a clever fiend, and he manipulates both Graham and the killer at large from his cell.</p><p> That killer, Francis Dolarhyde, works in a film lab, where he picks his victims by studying their home movies. He's obsessed with William Blake's bizarre painting <i>The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun</i>, believing there's a red dragon within him, the personification of his demonic drives. Flashbacks to Dolarhyde's terrifying childhood and superb stream-of-consciousness prose get us right there inside his head. When Dolarhyde does weird things, we understand why. We <i>sympathize</i> when the voice of the cruel dead grandma who raised and crazed him urges him to mayhem--she's way scarier than that old bat in <i>Psycho</i>. When he falls in love with a blind girl at the lab, we hope he doesn't give in to Grandma's violent advice.</p><p> This book is awesomely detailed, ingeniously plotted, judiciously gory, and fantastically imagined.

A. Salvatore is the acclaimed author of the DemonWars trilogy---The Demon Awakens, The Demon Spirit, and The Demon Apostle---as well as Mortalis, Bastion of Darkness, Ascendance, and the New York Times bestseller Vector Prime, an entry in the Star Wars: The New Jedi Order series. He lives in Massachusetts with his wife, Diane, and their three children. David Drummond has made his living as an actor for over twenty-five years, appearing on stages large and small throughout the country and in Seattle, Washington, his hometown. He has narrated over thirty audiobooks for Tantor, in genres ranging from current political commentary to historical nonfiction, from fantasy to military, and from thrillers to humor. He received an AudioFile Earphones Award for his first audiobook, Love &#39;Em or Lose &#39;Em: Getting Good People to Stay. When not narrating, David keeps busy writing plays and stories for children.Bestselling Salvatore (Starless Night) returns with a pleasant fantasy novel, notable mainly for its attention to detail. Salvatore describes and choreographs battle scenes better than any other contemporary fantasist, as this first tale of the adventures of Luthien Bedwyr amply demonstrates. The naive Luthien plunges into a series of events, beginning with a self-imposed exile from his father's kingdom of Bedwyr, which has fallen "under the iron rule of King Greensparrow of Avon," that test his mettle and increase the political stakes for which he must fight. As Salvatore carefully and exquisitely builds his narrative, Luthien, along with the charming Oliver de Burrows?self-described thief with the obligatory heart of gold?finds his actions becoming more consequential, especially in his Robin Hood-like guise as the "Crimson Shadow." The tale is satisfactorily resolved, but with enough matters left hanging to suggest that readers looking forward to a sequel may well be rewarded. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Suitable Boy</h2><p>Vikram Seth's novel is at its core a love story, a tale of Lata - and her mother's attempts to find a suitable boy, through love or through exacting maternal appraisal. Set in post-Independence India and involving the lives of four large families and those who orbit them, it is also a vast panoramic exploration of a whole continent at a crucial hour as a sixth of the world's population faces its first great General Election and the chance to map its own destiny. <p>'A Suitable Boy may prove to be the most fecund as well as the most prodigious work of the latter half of this century - perhaps even the book to restore the serious reading public's faith in the contemporary novel ... You should make time for it. It will keep you company for the rest of your life' Daniel Johnson, The Times</p></p><p>Vikram Seth was born in 1952. He trained as an economist and has lived for several years each in England, California, China and India. He is the author of A Suitable Boy, which was an international number one bestseller, An Equal Music and several other novels. He has also written five volumes of poetry including Beastly Tales. Reader biographies: Andrew Sachs (Manuel in Fawlty Towers) has performed widely in stage, film and television. He won Best Actor in the Sony Radio Awards 1989 and was Performer of the Year, Spoken Word Awards 1999. Fiona Shaw has starred on stage in Medea and The Prime of Miss Jean Brody among many others. Television roles range from Persuasion to Gormenghast. Feature films include My Left Foot, Jane Eyre, Anna Karenina and Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone.Set in newly independent India, Nehru's early 1950's, this adipose saga counterbalances a book of social manners--the marrying off of a well-to-do educated young woman, Lata Mehra--with a historical account (even at the level of transcribed parliamentary debate) of the subcontinent trying to find its societal bearings vis-...-vis language, religion, and the redistribution of estate-lands taken off the hands of the elite. Set mainly in Brahmpur, the story encompasses four well-off families, with a focus mostly on the younger members--poets, academics, playboys, newlyweds--who stitch a pattern of peccadillo through their elders' expectations. Meanwhile, Seth, whose California novel in verse, The Golden Gate (1986), was clever and energetic in concept but dull and soapy in final effect, falls into the same trap here: lots of stuff obviously--at a marathon 1300-plus pages--but characters made out of clich&#x201a;, with background-India the very stuffed pillow of local color that keeps them standing. The book, too, fairly squeaks with its own pleasure in itself, larded with poetry and a general recommendation of art over politics and money: the characters it spends the most time over are narcissists. Anyone wanting to read how a marriageable daughter can X-ray a whole society ought to let this cream-puff-wrapped-in-a-cinder-block pass and return to Tanizaki's classic Japanese masterpiece, The Makioka Sisters. Fat (the publishing world's delayed reparation for Rushdie's Satanic Verses?) but fatuous.

She has one older brother, Art Schulze. The family moved to Austin, Minnesota, when Peg was eight. She had a happy and normal childhood except for a bout with polio which paralyzed her from the neck down and hospitalized her for nine months. However, she made nearly a complete recovery. She graduated from Austin High School and attended the University of Minnesota for one year.From a writer known for her fiction, a moving memoir about a 12-year-old who got polio in 1949 in Austin, Minnesota. Kehret (Earthquake Terror, 1996, etc.) describes the disease, the diagnosis, the severe symptoms, treatments, physical therapy, slow recovery, and return home with walking sticks--and how she was forever changed. After her fever broke and she lay paralyzed in the hospital, her parents delivered a big brown packet of letters from her classmates. ``I had a strange feeling that I was reading about a different lifetime . . . none of this mattered. I had faced death. I had lived with excruciating pain and with loneliness and uncertainty about the future. Bad haircuts and lost ball games would never bother me again.'' There are touching black-and-white photographs of her roommates, who had already been there for ten years. Kehret's were the only parents who visited her each Sunday, and soon ``adopted'' her fellow polio victims. A simple, direct, and sometimes self-deprecating style of writing tenderly draws readers into Kehret's experiences and the effects of the disease firsthand. Almost a half-century later, this lovely book refocuses attention on what matters most: health, love of family, friends, determination, generosity, and compassion.

Jesters and crowds flocked for the medieval St Bartholomew's Day celebrations, tournaments were plentiful and it became the location of London's most famous meat market. Yet in Tudor England, Smithfield had another, more sinister use: the public execution of heretics.</p><p><i>The Burning Time</i> is a vivid insight into an era in which what was orthodoxy one year might be dangerous heresy the next. The first martyrs were Catholics, who cleaved to Rome in defiance of Henry VIII's break with the papacy. But with the accession of Henry's daughter Mary - soon to be nicknamed 'Bloody Mary' - the charge of heresy was leveled against devout Protestants, who chose to burn rather than recant.</p><p>At the center of Virginia Rounding's vivid account of this extraordinary period are two very different characters. The first is Richard Rich, Thomas Cromwell's prot�g�, who, almost uniquely, remained in a position of great power, influence and wealth under three Tudor monarchs, and who helped send many devout men and women to their deaths. The second is John Deane, Rector of St Bartholomew's, who was able, somehow, to navigate the treacherous waters of changing dogma and help others to survive.</p><p><i>The Burning Time</i> is their story, but it is also the story of the hundreds of men and women who were put to the fire for their faith.</p></p><p>VIRGINIA ROUNDING is a writer, critic and former RLF Fellow at the Courtauld Institute of Art.

Twelve of the most familiar appear--pursued but never truly threatened by a bell-wearing cat--in this collection of stunning cutout compositions, accompanied by simple, sprightly verse. "But cats / can't fly / and they / can't soar; / and birds / know what / their wings are for." Lifesize and sporting plumage that, whether brilliant or muted, manages to suggest a feather's almost infinitely variegated hues, these are birds that truly soar. A succinct but informative glossary concludes this imaginative armchair excursion, which is at once an inspiring introduction to bird-watching and a pure visual treat. Ages 3-8. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> )<br><br>PreSchool-Grade 2-- This unusual book is both a story and a beginning nature guide. A pet cat wants to vary his diet with wild birds, but each attempt gains him only feathers. Twelve different bird species are carefully illustrated with scientific accuracy and can be used to teach identification; the final four pages offer additional facts. On each page, the bird's typical call is printed and plants pictured are named. The rhyming story appears in large, bold typeface, but the rhythm is somewhat awkward and the word choices forced. Against the white background, cut-outs of painted paper create vivid shapes that are not realistic and yet manage to include all the field identification marks. Small children will appreciate the apparent simplicity of the pictures while older readers will be more aware of their subtleties. --Carolyn Caywood, Virginia Beach Public Library<br> (<i>School Library Journal</i> )</p><h2>Roger Zelazny&#39;s Chaos and Amber (Dawn of Amber)</h2><p><p>In the nationally bestselling Roger Zelazny&#x2019;s The Dawn of Amber, John Gregory Betancourt began the epic exploration into how the world of Amber and all of its shadow worlds came into existence. The young warrior named Oberon, who is destined to found a dynasty and rule over Amber, was rescued from attacking hell creatures by his father, Dworkin, and introduced to his brothers and sisters&#x2014;and his heritage as a Prince of the Courts of Chaos.</p> <p>But the shadow world called Juniper, the home of Dworkin and his kin, came under deadly attack by unknown and overwhelming forces. After sending the rest of the family to distant shadow worlds for their own safety, Dworkin and Oberon, and Oberon&#x2019;s half-brother Aber, traveled to the center of the known universe and the lair of their enemies, the Courts of Chaos, to put an end to the undeclared blood feud.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In CHAOS AND AMBER, the story picks up with the arrival of the fleeing trio in the shadow world closest to the Courts, known as &#x201c;the Beyond.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p> <p>The Courts of Chaos are hostile to Dworkin and his kin, and potentially deadly to Oberon&#x2014;who barely survives several attempts on his life. Dworkin disappears after leaving for a meeting with King Uthor, ruler of the Courts. This leaves Oberon and Aber to uphold the family&#x2019;s honor on their own. But with the Beyond so close to Chaos, they know that their enemies are nearby and probably spying on their every move.</p> <p>Rumors are rampant the King Uthor is about to brand Dworkin a traitor, making it open season on him and his family. Oberon seeks allies among those family members who have political ties to the Courts, little realizing that every alliance comes with a price. In this case, it is a betrothal to a distant, monstrous cousin, and a knife fight to the death with one of the Courts most powerful princes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>JOHN GREGORY BETANCOURT is an editor, publisher, and bestselling author of science fiction and fantasy novels and short stories.

A melting pot of races born of the 400-year slave trade--Africans, indigenous Americans and their French, Spanish, German, Dutch and English colonizers--the identity of the Caribbean stands at the intersection of tourism, colonialism and tropicality. This deluxe large-format volume features hundreds of fascinating and unique photographs that span 100 years of Caribbean history, culture, industry and more, as well as the subsequent diaspora of its people to America, England and elsewhere.

Her mission for HelloFlo was to create a place where women and girls could learn about their bodies in an open and honest environment without any shame and with a healthy dose of humor.&nbsp; HelloFlo's first two videos, "The Camp Gyno" and "First Moon Party," have been viewed over 50 million times and show girls that while puberty can be a fun and awkward time, it can also be empowering. She lives in Brooklyn, NY, with her husband and her two children.&nbsp;<i>HelloFlo: The Guide, Period</i>. is her first book.<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p><p>There is no such thing as clean underwear. At least for a girl. You may start your day with a nice, fresh pair of underwear, but by your first trip to the bathroom? Yup, there&#x2019;s always something crusty waiting for you.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes less crusty than cottage-cheesy.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes less cottage-cheesy than yogurty.&nbsp;</p><p>It can often feel a bit like your body has taken it upon itself to produce its own personal dairy section. If you know what it&#x2019;s for, it can be magical (some might even say vagical). If you don&#x2019;t, it&#x2019;s shameful, confounding, embarrassing. But it&#x2019;s there. Always.</p><p>Being a girl is messy business. A fact widely known, though rarely discussed, by half the world&#x2019;s population. At nearly every stage of a girl&#x2019;s development something is spurting or sprouting or budding or blossoming. Garden metaphors abound! Based solely on evidence provided by decades of &#x201c;feminine hygiene&#x201d; advertisements, you&#x2019;d be forgiven for concluding that getting your period is basically a monthly frolic through a field of sweet-smelling flowers.&nbsp;</p><p>But have you ever actually spent any time in a garden? It is dirty business. Literally. Plus, there are thorns and worms and, if you know anything about gardening, likely some sort of manure. So while it&#x2019;s not a perfect field of sweet-smelling flowers, a real garden may actually be the perfect metaphor. Puberty is messy business.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, and there will be blood. A lot of it. Think: horror movie. Sometimes it may look and feel like a waterfall of blood when in actual fact you merely overslept and your maxi pad, the one that all the commercials tell you is so good at absorption, was simply not up to the task of your heavy flow day. Some people call those ruined panties &#x201c;period underwear&#x201d; and only pull them out of the drawer each month as needed. We like to think of them as our Red Badges of Courage.</p><p>And while we&#x2019;re on the topic of maxi pads, can we discuss the blue dye that we see in commercials as proof that the pads work? Since you probably haven&#x2019;t gotten your period yet, I want to let you in on a little secret: the blood you&#x2019;ll see when you get your period&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not blue. In fact, sometimes it&#x2019;s not red. It can be all sorts of shades from red to brown. Just being honest here. You&#x2019;ll find that&#x2019;s the tone of this whole book.</p><p>So why does puberty get such a clean rap in all the commercials? Why do we usually talk about what happens to our bodies as though actual<i>information</i> is a tampon we need to quietly slip up our sleeves when we walk across the room? I&#x2019;m not really sure. But what I do know is that it needs to change.</p><p>Girls, bear with me for a moment&#x2014;we need to loop in your grown-ups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Adults:&nbsp;</b></p><p>The girl sitting next to you is smart. She needs to know what&#x2019;s about to happen. Good thing you bought this book because I can guarantee the information she needs isn&#x2019;t at the bottom of a Yahoo Answers rabbit hole. It&#x2019;s a bit like reading <i>Are You There God? It&#x2019;s Me, Margaret</i> had it been written on the bathroom wall of Penn Station. With a Sharpie. Think that&#x2019;s an exaggeration? Please pause here for a moment and go Google pubic hair.&nbsp;</p><p>See?</p><p>Thanks to the prevalence of unrestricted pornography on the Internet it&#x2019;s nearly impossible to Google anything about female anatomy without being immediately confronted by pornographic images. In fact, some studies suggest that children are encountering online porn as young as eight. <i>Not your children, of course, never your children.</i> But the children they know and talk to and play with. That&#x2019;s because online porn is the contemporary equivalent of your friend&#x2019;s older brother&#x2019;s contraband issue of<i>Playboy</i> that somehow made its way to your sixth-grade sleepover.</p><p>But even without those images there is simply <i>so much</i> information out there. How can a curious young girl, in search of answers about the changes she is experiencing, going to be able to differentiate between what is true and what she finds on the fourth page of a grammar-free message board?</p><p>I believe it&#x2019;s critical for your girl to understand what&#x2019;s happening to her own body. She needs to know that the world may start treating her differently just because she now looks like a woman. She also needs to know the basic essential fact that puberty is connected to reproduction. If she&#x2019;s not armed with this information she will have a much harder time processing the world around her and making good decisions. So take a deep breath and kindly hand the book back to her.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Okay, Girls, back to you.</b></p><p>As founder of HelloFlo.com I&#x2019;ve been in the unique position to hear from thousands of girls and women about how they relate to their own bodies, and I&#x2019;ve come to realize that the way we talk about physical changes is, well, lacking. I&#x2019;m writing this book because you deserve honesty and real information. And you deserve to understand what&#x2019;s going on&#x2014;both in your body and in the world around you.</p><p>That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;ve written this book. To supply you with all the facts, even the messy ones and the ones you may find most embarrassing to talk about. And I&#x2019;m doing this in a way that acknowledges how intelligent and sophisticated you are.</p><p>Underlying everything HelloFlo does had been a determination to talk honestly with young women about what is happening with their bodies. No euphemisms, no avoidance, no blue dye.</p><p>We also celebrate it. Puberty is not a curse. It&#x2019;s confusing, uncomfortable, sometimes painful, but also interesting and ultimately powerful and empowering. It&#x2019;s like if a Girl Punk Band made a musical and your body was the orchestra. All Girl. All Punk. All power. That&#x2019;s what this book is&#x2014;Punk Rock Puberty.</p><p>There will be questions you were afraid to ask and ones you didn&#x2019;t know even existed. There will be answers. There will be jokes. There will be stories. Many true, sometimes mortifying, stories. There will be pictures. There will be drawings. There will be Instagrams. There will be Beyonc�. And most definitely there will be blood.</p><p>As corny as this sounds, it&#x2019;s my dream that every girl enters puberty with enough knowledge of what&#x2019;s going on in her body and mind to keep her confident throughout. I&#x2019;ve spoken to countless doctors, parents, and girls while writing this book, and I&#x2019;ve tried to put everything that&#x2019;s useful in these pages. I&#x2019;m not a doctor, I&#x2019;m not even an expert. What I am is a woman who was once a confused girl who made it her mission to remove some of that confusion for the girls that came after me.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p><b>Girl, You&#x2019;ll Be a Woman&nbsp;Soon</b></p><p>How soon is soon?&nbsp;</p><p>One year? Five years? Thirty minutes?&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#x2019;s start with the first question.</p><p>It&#x2019;s pretty much guaranteed that at some point your breasts will develop. Your period will arrive, and your body will start to bleed on a regular basis. (More on the bleeding later. I&#x2019;ll get to that.) It&#x2019;s also a sure thing to say you&#x2019;ll grow hair under your arms, between your legs, and on your legs. And these are just the changes you&#x2019;ll be able to see.</p><p>You may be thinking to yourself, that&#x2019;s a lot of changes. And you may be hoping that I can somehow tell you when to expect that change. I wish I could, but unfortunately I don&#x2019;t have that magical power. What I<i>can</i> tell you is what&#x2019;s behind all those changes and, hopefully, get you a bit more prepared to deal with them, perhaps even embrace them, when they come.</p><p>You are going to hear this a lot throughout this book, but the fact is that everyone&#x2019;s body is different and everyone has her own clock. This is an important thing to remember in life, not just about puberty. The truth is, so much of preparing for womanhood is preparing for things to happen to your body over which you have very little control. I can give you a rough idea of when these changes will start to occur, and in what order they will arrive, but that&#x2019;s about as good as a timetable gets.</p><p>Yes, it&#x2019;s frustrating. Yes, it would be nice if we were all born with a timetable we could look at in advance (Period Arrival time: Dec. 12, 1:15 p.m.), but that&#x2019;s not how things work.</p><p>The trick to dealing with puberty is to not give yourself a timetable. Try hard not to measure yourself by what&#x2019;s going on with your friends. Your friends&#x2019; bodies are their own and have nothing to do with yours. Some may develop earlier than yours, some may develop later. Whatever your timetable, it will be right. Because it&#x2019;s right for you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>But What&#x2019;s&nbsp;Normal?</b></p><p>Puberty can begin anywhere from eight to sixteen years old. That&#x2019;s a big span of time. Yes, the average age for first period is twelve years old, but remember how an average is calculated, it&#x2019;s all the numbers in the range added up and then divided by the actual number of data points. The average of twenty and eighty is fifty. See how that works? Fifty isn&#x2019;t particularly close to either of those numbers. This is important because many girls (and their parents) use that number twelve as some sort of goalpost for determining if they are normal. But you&#x2019;re normal even when you aren&#x2019;t the average.</p><p>If you&#x2019;re still caught up with the question of when, there is one factor that might be helpful. It&#x2019;s really the only one, and it&#x2019;s definitely not perfect. If you have access to them, ask your biological mother or aunts when they started experiencing the different parts of puberty. But even with that information, I&#x2019;m sorry to say it&#x2019;s not a guarantee the same will happen to you. One of the factors for the lack of precision is that the way we are living now is very different from the way your mother and aunts grew up. Not that long ago, puberty would arrive similar to a line of falling dominoes. Your breasts would start developing, you&#x2019;d get hair under your arms, your period would arrive&#x2014;all in the course of a year or two.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, however, doctors are noticing that puberty begins much earlier than it used to and lasts much longer. So you may get breasts but then not get your period for another three years. Scientists aren&#x2019;t sure why this is happening. It may have something to do with all the light we&#x2019;re exposed to&#x2014;think about it. One hundred years ago some people didn&#x2019;t even have electricity let alone an iPhone they took to bed&#x2014;that&#x2019;s interfering with our sleep and growth patterns. It may also have something to do with the food we eat and how it&#x2019;s cultivated. It may even be from the chemicals in the air or water. It may be from all of these factors working together or something I haven&#x2019;t mentioned. There are many theories, but no one has the answer yet.</p><p>The point is, it&#x2019;s harder than ever to predict when puberty will start and how long it will last. While there&#x2019;s never really been such a thing as<i>normal, </i>even the normal ranges we used to refer to no longer apply the way they did.<i>&nbsp;</i>Your body is running a solo show here. All you can do is pay attention, and be prepared.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Rube Goldberg&nbsp;Machine</b></p><p>A&nbsp;Rube Goldberg machine is a great metaphor for hormones&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a complicated piece of machinery that is designed to perform a relatively simple task. The machine works through a series of chain reactions. Chain reactions are what we need to talk about now. I&#x2019;m going to oversimplify here, so bear with me. In your body, the machine that triggers the chain reaction known as puberty is your ovaries. Actually, it really starts with an area of your brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus releases a hormone that causes the pituitary gland to release a hormone that, essentially, wakes up the ovaries. We&#x2019;ll talk about the other function of ovaries later but for now here&#x2019;s what you need to know.</p><p>Until you enter puberty your ovaries are basically like lightbulbs that have been dimmed really, really low: They&#x2019;re there, but they&#x2019;re not doing a whole lot of anything. Then, when you begin puberty, the volume is turned up a little bit and they start to go to work. And by start to work, I mean they produce those hormones. When the ovaries start making estrogen and progesterone, the hormones then travel all over the body and tell different parts of the body to do different things&#x2014;breast development, hair growth, hip widening, and periods. It's one very complicated chain reaction.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>W-O-M-A-N-?</b></p><p>Most of what we&#x2019;ve discussed so far is mechanical. Hormones are released, and a series of chain reactions cause your body to change. It&#x2019;s all pretty simple when you look at it that way. But another way to look at it is that the chain reaction also starts you on the path to -adulthood&#x2014;or rather, womanhood.&nbsp;</p><p>So what does woman really mean? In my opinion this is actually one of the most important psychological aspects of puberty. Everyone starts saying you&#x2019;re a woman. But really, you&#x2019;re still a kid and you should enjoy being a kid.</p><p>What&#x2019;s different is that your body is preparing itself for doing grown-up things&#x2014;like being able to have a baby. &nbsp;</p><p>But that doesn&#x2019;t mean you&#x2019;re <i>ready</i> to have a baby. You may not be ready to have a baby for a long, long, long time. You may never want to have a baby.&nbsp;</p><p>Just remember that the ability to have a baby does not mean you&#x2019;re no longer a kid. It just means that you&#x2019;re a kid whose ovaries have started producing hormones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>But&nbsp;how will it feel?&nbsp;Can you tell me?</b></p><p>Yes, I can tell you how it&#x2019;s going to feel. Or at least I can give you a good idea of how it will feel. And I will. In each chapter we&#x2019;ll talk about how the changes might affect your day-to-day life, and how to deal with each of these changes so that you feel like you&#x2019;re in control of your own body. The more you know what&#x2019;s going on, and what will go on, the less scary everything will be (this is true in life also). And a lot of these things might not be scary at all! Sure, sometimes some of these changes might feel uncomfortable, but they won&#x2019;t ever keep you from doing the things you want to do. It&#x2019;s just a matter of being prepared.</p><p>And that&#x2019;s what this book is about. It&#x2019;s about explaining to you exactly what is going on in your body, and all the different ways you can take care of it. And like I said earlier, I&#x2019;m going to tell it to you honestly and won&#x2019;t use any euphemisms because nothing about this topic embarrasses me, and it shouldn&#x2019;t embarrass you, either.</p></p><h2>Warcry (Chronicles of the Warlands)</h2><p>All is not well in Xy.

Located on Broadway between 52nd and 53rd streets, the club named for the incomparable Charlie "Bird" Parker boasted lifesize photo murals of modern jazzmen like Dizzy Gillespie, Lennie Tristano, and, of course, Bird himself, looming large against jet black walls. Exotic live birds perched in cages behind the bar. The midget master of ceremonies, 3'9" Pee Wee Marquette, dressed in a zoot suit and loud tie, smoked huge cigars and screeched mispronounced introductions into the microphone. And the jazz-struck young Crow would park in the bleachers till 4 am, blissfully enveloped by the heady music of Bird, Bud Powell, Max Roach, and a host of other jazz giants.<br> <em>From Birdland to Broadway</em> is an enthralling insider's account of four decades of a life in jazz. Bill Crow, journeyman bass player, superb storyteller, and author of the successful <em>Jazz Anecdotes</em>, here narrates many moving and delightful tales of the pioneers of modern jazz he played with and was befriended by. We find Dizzy Gillespie, with whom Crow, because of prior commitments, regretfully declined steady work, dancing at the Royal Roost, Stan Getz sadly teetering on the brink of losing himself to drugs, and Harry Belafonte (known then as "the Cinderella Gentleman") running a lunch counter in New York's Sheridan Square between music dates. And we also witness many of the highlights of Crow's career, such as in 1955 when the Marian McPartland Trio (with Crow on bass) was named "Small Group of the Year" by <em>Metronome</em>; Crow playing with the Gerry Mulligan Quartet at venues like Storyville in Boston and Harlem's Apollo Theater (where they appeared with Dinah Washington); and the tour of the Soviet Union with Benny Goodman, a journey that might have been a high point of Crow's travels abroad but was marred by Goodman's legendary mistreatment of his band.<br> Moving beyond jazz clubs to the Broadway concert pit and a variety of studio gigs in the '60s, Crow encounters actors such as Yul Brynner and pop-rock acts like Simon and Garfunkel. From the great to the near-great, from Billie Holiday to Judy Holliday, Bill Crow's wealth of personal anecdotes takes the reader from Birdland, to the Half Note, to the Playboy Club, to the footlights of Broadway. This revealing book is a marvelous portrait of the jazz world, told by someone who's been there.<br></p><p>In the course of his long career as a bassist, Bill Crow has rubbed elbows with such luminaries as Gerry Mulligan, Marian McPartland, Stan Getz, and Duke Ellington (who coached him through a one-nighter by pointing to the appropriate notes on his keyboard a half-beat before they were played by the orchestra). Still, Crow's vantage point is largely that of a supporting player, bouncing from gig to gig and trimming his style to fit the circumstances. Luckily for us, he's written it all down in <i>From Birdland to Broadway,</i> which is both a spirited account of the freelancer's hand-to-mouth existence and a portrait gallery of Crow's exalted employers. The Seattle native arrived in Manhattan in 1950 with a valve trombone, which he later exchanged for a string bass. He began his jazz education at Birdland--then a kind of world headquarters for bop and progressive swing masters--and went on to play in trios, quartets, big bands, and Broadway pit orchestras (including an eight-year run with 42nd Street). Crow's account of this musical odyssey is a delight: modest, specific, and packed with low-key comedy.Bill Crow, journeyman bass player, superb storyteller, and author of the successful Jazz Anecdotes, here narrates many moving and delightful tales of the pioneers of modern jazz with whom he played and who befriended him.</p><h2>Sneaky Pie&#39;s Cookbook for Mystery Lovers</h2><p>Favorite recipes and anecdotes from the co-author of the Mrs. Murphy Mysteries.<br><br>Sneaky Pie Brown, co-author of such irresistible Mrs. Murphy mysteries as <b>Murder on the Prowl</b>, dishes up delectable fare for cats and humans alike in this unique collection of recipes spiced with witty personal anecdotes, including glimpses of life with co-author Rita Mae Brown.<br><br>What do you serve when a kitty is bored with all the old standbys? Since cookbooks are written by humans for humans, Sneaky Pie Brown has produced a cookbook with appeal for fastidious felines, including such treats as Veal Kidney and Salmon Pie.<br><br>Ever the thoughtful hostess, Miss Pie has also included plenty of recipes to accommodate the visiting human or finicky dog. There's Mother's Fried Chicken, Christmas Goose, Big Dog's Delight, and, of course, Mrs. Hogendobber's Orange Buns, the very thought of which makes Mrs. Murphy fans' mouths water.<br><br>Throughout there are also delightfully illustrated anecdotes for those Sneaky Pie fans eager to learn more about the dashing author. She even spills the beans about what happened to Rita Mae's brand-new pickup when a neighbor came calling with his goat.<br><br>For cats and cat lovers, this book combines real and tasty recipes with the same droll humor that made one reviewer declare, "As feline collaborators go, you couldn't ask for better than Sneaky Pie Brown, the canny tiger cat" (<b>The New York Times Book Review</b>).</p><p>Sneaky Pie Brown, a tiger cat born somewhere in Albemarle County, Virginia, was discovered by Rita Mae Brown at her local SPCA.

We are obligate carnivores, which means we must eat meat to stay healthy. Not that one has to eat as much as my sidekick Pewter, whose butt is so big you could show a movie on it. A kitty should know his or her limits.<br><br>I've included my favorite recipes plus a few for humans, dogs, and even a couple for horses.<br><br>Personally, I enjoy eating with humans but I refuse to eat with dogs. All that gobbling and swallowing chunks of food whole just turns my stomach. Then you spend the rest of the day listening to the symphony played by their intestines. Cats are ever so elegant compared to dogs.<br><br>I have personally tested each cat recipe, Tucker has tested the dog recipes and my veterinarian, Christopher Middleton, has checked them out, too. I've noted serving sizes only on those recipes for humans. The servings for cats, dogs, and a few others will vary from animal to animal. Tell your human to consider these treats. I'm assuming your regular diet has the protein and carbohydrates you need plus a touch of fat for the winter.<br><br>You'll find no recipes for mouse tartare, mole souffl�, or batwing soup. If I included them and your humans read this, the poor souls would faint dead away. You know how squeamish they are. Imagine telling them how to bite off a mouse's head? Get the smelling salts!<br><br>I hope you enjoy these and I wish you bon app�tit and good health.<br><br>Yours in Catitude, <br><br>Sneaky Pie<br><b>Cat: New Year's Tuna</b><br><br>1 (6-ounce) can tuna packed in oil--unless you're fat, then use a can of tuna packed in water<br><br>1/2 pint half-and-half (Again, if you're a fat cat change that to an equal amount of 2% milk.)<br><br>1.

And although we all deserve a great big treat on New Year's Eve, this is probably enough for you and a feline friend.<br><br>2. Serve precisely at twelve o'clock midnight for a prosperous New Year.<br>As you know, I live in the South, which means that each New Year's Eve the humans are boiling black-eyed peas. The first food of the New Year they put in their mouths has to be black-eyed peas. You won't catch me eating a black-eyed pea or any other pea for that matter.<br><br>Most New Years around here are pretty much the same. Mother intends to stay awake until midnight. She places pots and pans by the door with a giant spoon, the idea being that after her mouthful of black-eyed peas, she goes outside and bangs the pots. The horses hate it, of course.<br><br>Out here in the country, people shoot rifles in the air, set off firecrackers, and make a great deal of noise. In the icy January air, with no leaves on the trees to muffle sound, those sounds carry. There's a lot of stall banging and loud complaints from the stable on New Year's Eve.<br><br>The New Year's Eve I remember best occurred when Pewter and I were kittens. The Corgi wasn't born yet. Mom waited until December 31 to buy a truck. Her first new truck. Pewter and I ran outside to admire the Ford F150 4 x 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The metallic royal blue exterior seemed deeper against the white snow. The interior was a handsome beige. Naturally, our human was over the moon.<br><br>A mile and a half down our road lived a simpleminded neighbor two years older than God. I don't think I've ever seen a human that old before or since. No one called him by his last name because his uncle had been governor of Virginia back in the forties and a governor couldn't have a simpleminded nephew.&nbsp;&nbsp;As he was a short, energetic man, everyone just called him Banty.<br><br>Banty lived alone since his family had long been dead. He adored my mother because she spoke to him as though he was just like everyone else. Now, why he wanted to be just like anyone else mystifies me because the truth about Virginians is that one out of four is mentally ill. Think of your three best friends. If they're all right, then it's you! Mother's mother told her that and it's the God's honest truth--not that anyone from Virginia will admit it.<br><br>Anyway, Banty desperately wanted to be like everyone else. He'd visit and bring us fresh-grown catnip. What money his family had put aside for him had been exhausted decades ago--no one had ever expected him to live to such an advanced age. He cut his own wood for his wood-burning stove and his cookstove. He raised chickens and sold eggs. He also had goats for milk and he'd learned to make goat's milk soap, and a fine soap it was.<br><br>This particular New Year's Eve the evening temperature skidded into the teens. The day had been warmer, the low forties, and the snow melted a bit, which meant on top of the snow rested a treacherous layer of ice.<br><br>Mom had parked her new truck by the front door so she could look at it constantly. Before sunset she hopped into her old truck one last time, a worn 1972 Ford, and drove it down to the dealer. He would carry her home.<br><br>Banty, with a goat on a leash, a gift for Mom, walked up to the front door and knocked, but Mom wasn't home. We meowed. He opened the door a crack, thought better of it, and closed the door. The night was so bitter, he didn't want to leave the nanny goat tied to a fence. And if he turned the goat out in a pasture it would follow him home. So he opened the door of the brand-new truck and the goat jumped right in. Perfect. He slipped and slid down the driveway, walking the mile and a half back to his little house in the hollow.<br><br>Mom showed up in the driveway about an hour after that. She hopped out of the passenger seat and waved good-bye to the Ford dealer.<br><br>We watched from the picture window as she admired her truck. She took a step closer. Stopped. Then moved as fast as we'd ever seen Mom move. Remarkable, really, given the ice. She opened the door to behold her present from Banty, and the fact that her truck now had no interior. The nanny goat even ate hunks out of the dash.<br><br>Mom lifted the goat out of the truck, sat down on the front steps, and cried. Finally she pulled herself together, walking the goat down to the garden shed. She couldn't put the nanny in with the horses because the scent of a goat will drive them crazy until they become accustomed to it. If you live in the city you might not know it but goats stink to high heaven.<br><br>She emptied out the garden shed, brought hay and straw up from the barn, falling down a couple of times in the process. It was getting colder and colder--so cold that the inside of your nose hurt when you breathed. Still, she was out there for over an hour.<br><br>When she reached the house her lips were blue. We loved on her and warmed her up as much as we could. She was distraught. How do you explain a situation like this to your insurance agent?<br><br>She called him at home. He said, "Happy New Year and don't worry."<br><br>Well, she felt somewhat better. She made Pewter and me some New Year's Tuna. Then she cooked herself black-eyed peas for luck. And you know, that turned out to be one of the best years we ever had, although I never have learned to tolerate the nanny goat, Princess Vandal.</p><h2>The Genie King (Secrets of Droon)</h2><p>The secret is out--DROON is the series that kids, parents, and teachers are talking about!

After three years, the brothers published the first natural history book entirely illustrated with photographs; it changed the way people view birds and their nests, inspiring them to protect them rather than plunder them.</p><p><b>REBECCA BOND</b> grew up in the tiny village of Peacham in northeastern Vermont. When she is not having fun painting and writing, Rebecca is busy fixing up her new (to her) old house in a neighborhood in Jamaica Plain, Boston.Grade 1&#x2013;4&#x2014;The cover illustration of a young man carrying an ox on his head should draw children to this picture-book biography of two late-19th century nature photographers from Yorkshire, England. Raised in the countryside, Richard and Cherry Kearton were brothers who produced the first photographic nature book. They worked in London but often escaped with a camera to take pictures of birds, and their nests and eggs. Highly adventurous, the men hid in animal skins and haystacks and climbed, crawled, and waded through bogs to get their shots. Bond's writing is often poetic and captures a sense of wonder: "They especially marveled at the architecture of living things: The structure of nests. The lattice of webs." Sepia ink and watercolor artwork features pale skies and soft-edged hills. A closing spread of photos gives credence to the highly unlikely images of the ox on Cherry Kearton's head and of the brothers standing on a ladder precariously placed on a thin branch in a tall tree. End matter includes quotes and notes on the naturalists' lives following the publication of their groundbreaking work. The book has pleasing prose, attractive illustrations, and a message on early environmentalism. Its popularity is limited only by the obscurity of its subjects.&#x2014;<i>Ellen Heath, Easton Area Public Library, Easton, PA</i> END</p><h2>The Eye of the Tiger</h2><p><p>The deep. The deadly.

I felt, too, that the trial God had appointed me was gaining its climax, and must now be turned by my own hands, hot, feeble, trembling as they were&#39; With neither friends nor family, Lucy Snowe sets sail from England to find employment in a girls&#39; boarding school in the small town of Villette. There she struggles to retain her self-possession in the face of unruly pupils, an initially suspicious headmaster and her own complex feelings, first for the school&#39;s English doctor and then for the dictatorial professor Paul Emmanuel. Drawing on her own deeply unhappy experiences as a governess in Brussels, Charlotte Bront�&#39;s last and most autobiographical novel is a powerfully moving study of isolation and the pain of unrequited love, narrated by a heroine determined to preserve an independent spirit in the face of adverse circumstances. The Penguin English Library - 100 editions of the best fiction in English, from the eighteenth century and the very first novels to the beginning of the First World War.</p><p>With her final novel, <i>Villette</i>, Charlotte Bronte reached the height of her artistic power. First published in 1853, <i>Villette</i> is Bronte's most accomplished and deeply felt work, eclipsing even <i>Jane Eyre</i> in critical acclaim. Her narrator, the autobiographical Lucy Snowe, flees England and a tragic past to become an instructor in a French boarding school in the town of Villette. There, she unexpectedly confronts her feelings of love and longing as she witnesses the fitful romance between Dr. John, a handsome young Englishman, and Ginerva Fanshawe, a beautiful coquetter. This first pain brings others, and with them comes the heartache Lucy has tried so long to escape. Yet in spite of adversity and disappointment, Lucy Snowe survives to recount the unstinting vision of a turbulent life's journey--a journey that is one of the most insightful fictional studies of a woman's consciousness in English literature.Arguably Bronte&#39;s most refined and deeply felt work, Villette draws on her experiences as a student in Brussels as well as her profound loneliness following the deaths of her three siblings. Lucy Snowe, the narrator of Villette, flees from an unhappy past in England to begin a new life as a teacher at a French boarding school in the great cosmopolitan capital of Villette. Soon Lucy&#39;s struggle for independence is overshadowed by both her friendship with a worldly English doctor and her feelings for an autocratic schoolmaster. Bronte&#39;s strikingly modern heroine must decide if there is any man in her society with whom she can live and still be free.</p><h2>Dimensions.

Major ad/promo.</p><p>The second in a projected series of four works on the structure of male archetypes, based on Jungian psychology, this study follows The King Within by the same authors. Moore, a professor of psychology and religion at the Chicago Theological Seminary, and Gillette, a graduate of that seminary and a pastoral counselor, hew closely to the Jungian party line, explaining with exceptional clarity the concepts of archetypes, the Ego, the Transpersonal Other (God for many individuals), the Self and the Shadow. Their thesis is simple: the Warrior is an integral part of the male psyche, but it must be socialized so that it does not lead the man to either sadism or masochism, and it must be incorporated with the King, the Magician and the Lover to achieve its fullest expression. The authors, both of whom are active in the men's movement, obviously feel that the Warrior's existence must be recognized, not repressed, because its unharnessed potential threatens psychic stability. Their book offers much food for thought.

Barash has been gardening, eating flowers, and cooking since she was a child. Her articles and photographs have appeared in the New York Times, Organic Gardening, New York magazine, Woman&#39;s Day, Home, Countryside, and others.Barash ( Evening Gardens ), a gardener, a writer and a photographer, here offers a more than generous anthology of ideas for bringing together flowers and foods at the table. The book is not recipes only. Barash also includes information about the etymological history of plant names, the plants' growing habits, how to cultivate them, identify them in the wild and gather them for eventual use in the kitchen. She makes an admirable effort to provide inventive and appealing offerings: "Candied Pea Blossoms on Salmon Toast Points," for example, lays 20 pea flowers on an array of toast slices; clover finds its way into biscuits and pickles; lavender goes into soup, chutney, cookies, ice creams and fish dishes. It may seem fanciful to consider adding lilac blossoms to yogurt, then downing it, but she convinces, and sometimes entrances, with floral crossovers. And wisely, the author includes a list of poisonous plants and flowers, along with a generous bibliography.

A dragon embodied the yang, the mascu�line principle of life, and it was thought that if a couple expecting a child prayed to the dragon&#x2019;s egg, their offspring would be male. Of course, every family in those days desired a son over a daughter. Only men could carry on the family line; women&nbsp; were merely ves�sels by which to provide society with an uninterrupted supply of men. So every day for months before I was born, my parents would rise before dawn, carrying offerings of fresh-steamed rice cakes to the stone well behind our home, as the sky brightened and snuff ed out the stars. And they would pray to the pale freckled face of the moon floating on the water&#x2019;s surface, pray that the child growing inside my mother&#x2019;s womb would be a boy. <br>In this they were to be disappointed. On the third day of the First Moon in the Year of the Rooster, their first and only daughter was born to them. In those waning days of the Yi Dynasty, new�born girls&nbsp; were not deemed important enough to be graced with formal names, but&nbsp; were instead given nicknames. Often these repre�sented some personal characteristic: Cheerful, Pretty, Little One, Big One. Sometimes they presumed to be commandments: Chastity, or Virtue. A few&#x2014;Golden Calf, Little Flower&#x2014; verged on the po�etic. But too many names reflected the parents&#x2019; feelings about the birth of a daughter. I knew a girl named Anger, and another called Pity. More than a few&nbsp; were known as Sorrow or Sadness. And ev�eryone had heard the story of the father who named his firstborn daughter &#x201c;One is Okay,&#x201d; his next, &#x201c;Perhaps After the Second,&#x201d; the third, &#x201c;Three Laughs,&#x201d; and the last, &#x201c;Four Shames.&#x201d; <br>As for me, my parents named me &#x201c;Regrettable&#x201d;&#x2014;eventually shortened to simply Regret. <br>Koreans seldom address one another by their given names; we believe a person&#x2019;s name is a thing of intimacy and power, not to be used casually by anyone but a family member or close friend. When I was very young, Regret was merely a name to me, signi�fying nothing more than that. But as I grew older and learned it held another meaning, it became a stone weight in my heart. A call to supper became a reminder of my unfortunate presence at the dinner table. A stern rebuke by my father&#x2014;&#x201c;Regret, what are we to do with you?&#x201d;&#x2014;seemed to hint that my place in the family was impermanent. Too young to understand the real reasons, I won�dered what was wrong with me to make me so unwanted. Was I too short? I&nbsp; wasn&#x2019;t as tall as my friend Sunny, but not nearly so short as her sister Lotus. Was I too plain? I spent hours squinting into the mirror, judging my every feature, and found them want�ing. My eyes&nbsp; were set too close together, my nose was too small, or maybe it was too big; my lips&nbsp; were thin, my ears flat. It was clear to see, I was plain and unlovely&#x2014;no wonder my parents regretted my birth. <br>In truth, my father was merely old-fashioned and conservative, a strict adherent to Confucian ideals, one of which was the inher�ent pre ce dence of man over woman: &#x201c;The wife must regard her husband as heavenly; what he does is a heavenly act and she can only follow him.&#x201d; I was a girl, I would eventually marry and be�come part of someone&nbsp; else&#x2019;s family; as such my existence was sim�ply not of the same consequence as that of my three brothers, who would carry on the family line and provide for our parents when they became old. <br>But I knew none of this when I was young, and instead decided it was due to the shape of my nose or the color of my eyes; and for years to come I would fret over and find fault with the girl who looked back at me from the mirror. <br>I have traveled far from the land of my birth, and even farther from who I was then. More than forty years and four thousand miles separate us: the girl of sixteen who took that fi rst unwitting step forward, and the woman in her sixtieth year who now, in sight of the vast Pacific, presumes to memorialize this journey in mere words. It is a journey measured not in time or distance, but in the breadth of one&#x2019;s soul and the struggle of becoming. <br>Excerpted from Honolulu by Alan Brennert.<br>Copyright � 2009 by Alan Brennert.<br>Published in February 2010 by St. Martin's Press.<br>All rights reserved.

The same faces, the same photos. Every family was touched by the war and every family has an album like this. Even as we prepare to open it, the act of looking at the album is overlaid by the emotions it will engender. We look at the pictures as if reading a poem about the experience of seeing them.<br><br>I turn the dark, heavy pages. The dust smell of old photographs. <br><br>The dead queuing up to enlist. Marching through the dark town, disappearing beyond the edge of the frame. Some turn up later, in the photos from hospital: marching away and convalescing, nothing in between. Always close to hand, the countryside seems empty in these later pictures, a register of absence. Dry stone walls and rivers. Portraits and group portraits. Officers and other ranks. The loved and the unloved, indistinguishable from each other. <br><br>'Memory has a spottiness,' writes Updike, 'as if the film was sprinkled with developer instead of immersed in it.' Each of these photos is marred, spotted, blotched; their imperfections make them seem like photos of memories. In some there is an encroaching white light, creeping over the image, wiping it out. Others are fading: photos of forgetting. Eventually nothing will remain but blank spaces.<br><br>A nurse in round glasses and long uniform ('Myself' printed beneath in my grandmother's perfect hand).

Able only to read and write his name. Enlisted in 1914. Served on the Somme as a driver (of horses), where, according to family legend, he once went up to the front-line trenches in place of a friend whose courage had suddenly deserted him. Later, back in the reserve trench, he shovelled the remains of his best friend into a sandbag. (Every family has the same album, every family has a version of the same legend.) Returned to Shropshire in 1919 and resumed the life he had left.<br><br>Worked, went to war, married, worked.<br><br>He died aged ninety-one, able still only to write his name. Everything I have said about my grandfather is true. Except he is not the man second from the left in the photograph. I do no know who that is. It makes no difference. He could be anyone's grandfather.<br><br>Like many young men, my grandfather was under age when he turned up to enlist. The recruiting sergeant told him to come back in a couple of days when he was two years older. My grandfather duly returned, added a couple of years to his age and was accepted into the army.<br><br>Similar episodes are fairly common in the repertoire of recruitment anecdotes, but I never doubted the veracity of this particular version of it, which my mother told several times over the years. It came as a surprise, then, to discover from his death certificate that my grandfather was born in November 1893 (the same year as Owen), and so was twenty years when war broke out. One of the commonly circulating stories of the 1914 generation had been so thoroughly absorbed by my family that it had become part of my grandfather's biography.<br><br>He is everyone's grandfather.<br><br>*<br><br>Seven-thirty a.m. Mist lies over the fields of the Somme. Trees are smudged shapes. Nothing moves. Power lines sag and vanish over absent hedges. Birds call invisibly. Only the road can be sure of where it is going. <br><br>I stop for breakfast &#x2014; an apple, a banana, yoghurt slurped from the carton &#x2014; and consult the map I bought yesterday. A friend who was driving from Paris to catch a dawn ferry at Calais had given me a lift to Amiens. From there I hitched in the direction of Albert because, from my newly acquired map, it was the nearest station to the villages whose names I vaguely recognize: Beaumont-Hamel, Mametz, Pozi�res . . . I want to visit the cemeteries of the Somme but have no clear idea of what they are like or which ones are particularly worth visiting. On my map, near Thiepval, is printed in heavy type: 'Memorial Brit.' When I began hitching this morning, I did not know what I would find or where I would go &#x2014; I still don't, except that at some point in the day I will visit Thiepval. For now I cram everything back in my rucksack and continue walking.<br><br>Within an hour, exactly as forecast, the mist starts to thin. Level slopes of fields appear. The dusty blaze of rape. Dipping flatness. I walk towards a large cemetery, the most distant rows of headstones barely visible.<br><br>The cemetery is separated from the surrounding field by a low wall, dissolved in places by the linger of mist. Close to this wall a large cross appears as a mossy blur, like the trunk of a tree. The noise of the gate being unlatched sends birds flocking from branches and back. The gravel is loud beneath my feet. Near the gate, on a large stone &#x2014; pale, horizontal, altar-like &#x2014; is written:<br><br>THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE<br><br>Between this stone and the cross are rows of white headstones, bordered by perfect grass. Flowers: purple, dull red, flame-yellow.<br><br>Most of the headstones give simply the regiment, name, rank and, where it is known, the date of the soldier's death, sometimes his age. Occasionally quotations have been added, but the elaborate biblical sentiments are superfluous; they neither add to nor detract from the uniform pathos of the headstones, some of which do not even bear a name:<br><br>A SOLDIER<br>OF THE GREAT WAR<br>KNOWN UNTO GOD<br><br>The cross has a bronze sword running down the centre, pointing to the ground. Gradually the mist thins enough for the cross to cast a promise of shadow, a darker haze, so faint it is barely there. Pale sunlight.<br><br>The high left-hand wall of the cemetery is a memorial to the New Zealand dead with no known graves 'who fell in the Battles of the Somme September and October 1916'. Inscribed along its length are 1,205 names. <br><br>Near the gate is a visitors' book and register of graves. The name of the cemetery is Caterpillar Valley. There are 5,539 men buried here.<br><i>'We will remember them'<br></i>The Great War ruptured the historical continuum, destroying the legacy of the past. Wyndham Lewis sounds the characteristic note when he calls it 'the turning-point in the history of the earth', but there is a sense in which, for the British at least, the war helped to preserve the past even as it destroyed it. Life in the decade and a half preceding 1914 has come to be viewed inevitably and unavoidably through the optic of the war that followed it. The past <i>as past</i> was preserved by the war that shattered it. By ushering in a future characterized by instability and uncertainty, it embalmed for ever a past characterized by stability and certainty.<br><br>Things were, of course, less settled than the habitual view of pre-August 1914 tempts us to believe. For many contemporary observers the war tainted the past, revealing and making explicit a violence that had been latent in the preceding peace. Eighty years on, this sense of crouched and gathering violence has been all but totally filtered out of our perception of the pre-war period. Militant suffragettes, class unrest, strikes, Ireland teetering on the brink of civil war &#x2014; all are shaded and softened by the long, elegiac shadows cast by the war.<br><br>European civilization may have been 'breaking down even before war destroyed it', but our abiding sense of the quietness of the Edwardian frame of mind is, overwhelmingly, derived from and enhanced by the holocaust that followed it. The glorious summer of 1914 seems, even, to have been generated by the cataclysm that succeeded it. <br><br>In a persuasive passage, Johan Huizinga admonished the historian to <br><br>maintain towards his subject an indeterminist point of view. He must constantly put himself at a point in the past at which the known factors still seem to permit different outcomes.<br><br>But history does not lie uniformly over events. Here and there in forms drifts &#x2014; and these drifts are at their deepest between the years 1914 and1918. Watching footage of the Normandy landings, we can experience D-Day <i>as it happened</i>. History hangs in the balance, waiting to be made. The Battle of the Somme, by contrast, is deeply buried in its own aftermath. The euphoric intoxication of the early days of the French Revolution &#x2014; 'Bliss was it in that dawn' &#x2014; remains undiminished by the terror lying in wait a few chapters on. The young men queuing up to enlist in 1914 have the look of ghosts. They are queuing up to be slaughtered: they are already dead. By Huizinga's terms, the Great War urges us to write the opposite of history: the story of effects generating their cause.<br><i>They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:<br>Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.<br>At the going down of the sun and in the morning<br>We will remember them.<br><br></i>These incantatory rhythms and mantra-like repetitions are intoned every year on Remembrance Day. They are words we hear but rarely see in print. We known them &#x2014; more or less &#x2014; by heart. They seem not to have been written but to have pulsed into life in the nation's collective memory, to have been generated, down the long passage of years, by the hypnotic spell of Remembrance they are used to induce.<br><br>But they <i>were </i>written, of course, by Laurence Binyon, in September 1914: <i>before</i> the fallen actually fell. 'For the Fallen', in other words, is a work not of remembrance but of anticipation, or more accurately, the <i>anticipation of remembrance</i>: a foreseeing that is also a determining.<br><br>On 22 August 1917 at Pilkem Ridge near Ypres, Ernest Brooks took one of the iconographic photographs of the Great War. Head bowed, rifle on his back, a soldier is silhouetted against the going down of the sun, looking at the grave of a dead comrade, remembering him. A photograph from the war &#x2014; the Battle of Third Ypres (or Passchendaele as it is better known) was still raging, the armistice was fifteen months distant &#x2014; it is also a photograph of the way the war will come to be remembered. It is a photograph of the future, of the future's great view of the past. It is a photograph of Binyon's poem, of a sentiment. We<i> will </i>remember them.<br>If several of the terms by which we remember the war were established in advance of its conclusion, many crucial elements were embodied in a single dramatic event two years before it started. <br><br>Between November 1911 and January 1912 two teams of men &#x2014; one British, headed by a naval officer, Robert Falcon Scott, the other Norwegian, headed by Roald Amundsen &#x2014; were engaged in the last stage of a protracted race to the South Pole. Using dogs and adapting themselves skilfully to the hostile environment, the Norwegian team reached the pole on 15 December and returned safely. Scott, leader of an ill-prepared expedition which relied on strength-sapping man-hauling, reached the Pole on 17 January. Defeated, the five-man team faced a gruelling 800-mile trudge back to safety. By 21 March, eleven miles from the nearest depot of food and fuel, the three exhausted surviving members of the expedition &#x2014; Scott, Dr Edward Wilson and Henry Bowers &#x2014; pitched their tent and sat out a blizzard. At some point Scott seems to have made the decision that it was better to stay put and preserve the record of their struggle rather than die in their tracks. They survived for at least nine days while Scott, in Roland Huntford's phrase 'prepared his exit from the stage' and addressed letters to posterity: 'We are setting a good example to our countrymen, if not by getting into a tight place, by facing it like men when we get there.' Despite its failure, the expedition, wrote Scott, 'has shown that Englishmen can endure hardships, help one another and meet death with as great a fortitude as ever in the past'. The tradition of heroic death which aggrandizes his own example is also invigorated by it: 'We are showing that Englishman can still die with a bold spirit, fighting it out to the end . . . I think this makes an example for Englishmen of the future.'<br><br>On 12 November, in the collapsed tent, the bodies and their documents were found by a rescue party and the legend of Scott of the Antarctic began to take immediate effect. 'Of their suffering, hardship and devotion to one another,' wrote a member of the rescue team, 'the world will soon know the deeds that were done were equally as great as any committed on Battlefield and won the respect and honour of every true Britisher.'</p><h2>Green Lantern: The Silver Age Vol. 3</h2><p><b>Perhaps the most famous of all the Green Lanterns, Hal Jordan put on the Lantern's ring for the first time in 1959.

Broome's first comic book sale was to Fawcett Comics for the South Seas adventure strip, <i>Lance O'Casey.</i> More work for Fawcett followed, including on <i>Captain Marvel,</i> before World War II interrupted his writing career. When he was released from the service, he looked up his old friend Julius Schwartz at DC and, for more than twenty years, made his creative home there, writing countless scripts for numerous features, including the Golden Age Green Lantern, Justice Society of America, Captain Comet, the Silver Age revival of Green Lantern, the Atomic Knights, Star Hawkins, Rex the Wonder Dog, Detective Chimp, and a variety of science fiction tales. Broome retired from comic books in the 1970s and settled in Japan where he taught English. John Broome died in Thailand in March 1999.</p><h2>Against the Grain: Christianity and Democracy, War and Peace</h2><p>Cutting against the grain of conventional wisdom, New York Times bestseller, George Weigel, offers a compelling look at the ways in which Catholic social teaching sheds light on the challenges of peace, the problem of pluralism, the quest for human rights, and the defense of liberty. In this major contribution one of America&#39;s most prominent intellectuals offers a meticulous analysis of the foundations of the free society as he makes a powerful case for the role of moral reasoning in meeting the threats to human dignity posed by debonair nihilism, jihadist violence, and the brave new world of manufactured men and women.</p><p>In this collection of 12 previously published essays, each revised considerably for this volume, noted Catholic pundit Weigel (<i>Pope John Paul II, Witness to Hope</i>) ranges provocatively over a diverse selection of topics from social justice and abortion to atheism and just war. Underlying many of the essays is the idea of Christians as resident aliens in modern democracies who must, by their very callings, live in the world but not be of the world. As he observes, sometimes Christians may feel more like residents when their views of justice or compassion are more compatible with the world's views (as in Vatican II), but many times they will feel more like aliens (as during the Nazi regime) because their call to justice conflicts directly with that of the reigning political powers. Weigel points out that the Church can best influence public policy when it is a community of faith and love that emphasizes the flourishing of the individual over the success of a totalitarian state. While Weigel's deeply considered reflections on the Iraq War as a just war are certain to provoke reaction among his critics, his thoughtful essays on democracy and religion offer new insights into the meaning of Catholic social doctrines for the 21st century. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He spends half the year in St. Petersburg, Florida, and the rest on the road.Thomas was a knight in mid-14th-century France before war, betrayal, and the Black Plague reduces him to banditry. But his road to oblivion in a nearly dead world ends with meeting Delphine, a young girl speaking with the voice of what may be angels&#x201a;--�she could be a saint, or a witch. Thomas can't ignore his compulsion to join her quest to go to Avignon, home of the pope, undertaken for reasons unknown even to her. But they and their companion Pv(r)re Matthieu don't realize they're trapped in a cosmic battle between good and evil, God having withdrawn from the world and Lucifer bent on filling the vacuum. until nightmarish creatures rise up everywhere to stop Delphine. Buehlman's (Those Across the River) medieval world is detailed with both sweet-smelling air and the gory results of plague, brutal but where hard-won small victories may add up faster than vast defeats. Thomas is the perfect everyman whose virtuous and sinful sides war internally as much as his sword arm battles in the physical world; Delphine is equally well drawn, part prophet and part frightened child. Fans of historical fantasy and horror will find this epic darkly rewarding.</p><h2>Lonely Planet Supercargo: A Journey Among Ports</h2><p><p>The wide, unbounded oceans of the world have always fascinated travellers, as have the restless port cities that connect land to sea. But has the romance that has always surrounded sea travel survived in an era of rationalised ports and sparsely crewed container ships? </p><p>Thornton McCamish sets out from London, one of the world&#x2019;s great maritime cities, in search of whatever remains of the rough-and-ready life of those who work and travel by water. In ports big, small, ancient, modern and deservedly forgotten he seeks for the world of sea dogs, old salts and adventure &#x2013; and finds bad food, themed bars, model ships and prostitutes. As he circumnavigates the Mediterranean and follows the ancient spice and slaver routes around Cape Horn and across the Indian Ocean to Kochi, he gradually finds that the mystery and menace of the oceans endure beneath and parallel to our globalised world. <i>Supercargo</i> is a penetrating and wickedly funny study of a way of life and travel that refuses to die.</p></p><p>McCamish, an Australian journalist and playwright based in London, sets out to reach various port cities of the Mediterranean, Africa, and India aboard freighters. His aim is to describe not only the ports he visits but also the crews and the far-from-glamorous life onboard. His journey begins in Marseilles, then proceeds to Tunis and ports in Corsica, Sardinia, mainland Italy, Greece, Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey. On the next leg of the journey, he starts in the Canaries and then travels to Capetown, the east coast of Africa, and finally southern India. For the most part, life aboard ship is exciting but often miserable, with terrible food and poor quarters. But despite the hardships, McCamish preserves his humorous style till the very end. For the American reader, some of the British/Australian language and references may be hard to decipher. Also, some photographs of the ships or the port cities would have lent a great deal to the prose. Recommended for public libraries. George M.

Nurture is the nuts or frosting, but if you&#x2019;re a spice cake, you&#x2019;re a spice cake, and nothing is going to change you into an angel food.<br><br>Tall, slender Violet Mathers is growing up in the Great Depression, which could just as well define her state of mind. Abandoned by her mother as a child, mistreated by her father, and teased by her schoolmates (&#x201c;Hey, Olive Oyl, where&#x2019;s Popeye?&#x201d;), the lonely girl finds solace in artistic pursuits. Only when she&#x2019;s hired by the town&#x2019;s sole feminist to work the night shift in the local thread factory does Violet come into her name, and bloom. Accepted by her co-workers, the teenager enters the happiest phase of her life, until a terrible accident causes her to retreat once again into her lonely shell.<br><br>Realizing that she has only one clear choice, Violet boards a bus heading west to California. But when the bus crashes in North Dakota, it seems that Fate is having another cruel laugh at Violet&#x2019;s expense. This time though, Violet laughs back. She and her fellow passengers are rescued by two men: Austin Sykes, whom Violet is certain is the blackest man to ever set foot on the North Dakota prairie, and Kjel Hedstrom, who inspires feelings Violet never before has felt. Kjel and Austin are musicians whose sound is like no other, and with pluck, verve, and wit, Violet becomes part of their quest to make a new kind of music together. <br><br>Oh My Stars is Lorna Landvik&#x2019;s most ambitious novel yet, with a cast of characters whose travails and triumphs you&#x2019;ll long remember. It is a tale of love and hope, bigotry and betrayal, loss and discovery&#x2013;as Violet, who&#x2019;s always considered herself a minor character in her own life story, emerges as a heroine you&#x2019;ll laugh with, cry with, and, most important, cheer for all the way.</p><p>Lorna Landvik is an actor and comedian who has written and produced plays in which she also performs. The author of five previous novels, she is married and the mother of two daughters.Chapter One<br><br>On her sixteenth birthday, violet mathers nearly bled to death in a thread factory. The &#x201c;incident,&#x201d; as it was referred to in the company&#x2019;s 1935 logbook, happened on the graveyard shift, just before break time, when the pounding and the whirring and the squeaking of the machines had crescendoed into a percussion concert conducted by the devil himself. Lamont Travers, the foreman, told her later in the hospital that the worst accidents always happen before break; people can&#x2019;t wait to smoke their cigarettes or drink their coffee and talk about whose man or whose woman had done who the wrongest. Violet hadn&#x2019;t cared about any of that; she wanted only to cut into the marble cake RaeAnn Puffer had brought, wanted only to hear her co-workers raise their tired, smoky voices in a chorus of &#x201c;Happy Birthday.&#x201d;<br><br>Excited and jumpy as a puppy with a full bladder, the birthday girl broke the cardinal rule of the Marcelline Thread factory, the cardinal rule printed in capital letters on at least three signs posted on the dusty brick walls: do not attempt to clear or repair the machinery without first turning machinery off.<br><br>She was running the Klayson, a big reliable machine that sweat oil as it wound and cut dozens of spools of thread. There were women who were possessive of their machines (Lula Wendell even named hers and explained that whenever the machine spit out thread or overwound, it was because &#x201c;Pauletta&#x201d; was on her monthly). Violet had formed no deep attachments to the masses of metal, preferring the job of &#x201c;runner&#x201d; and working whatever machine needed running. When she ran the Klayson, she felt as if she was wrangling a harmless but stubborn old cow, and it was almost with affection that she scolded the machine when it huffed and burped to a stop.<br><br>&#x201c;Now, come on, gal, I ain&#x2019;t got time for this,&#x201d; said Violet, and with one hand on the Klayson&#x2019;s metal flank, she stuck the other up into its privates, feeling for the tangled clot of thread.<br><br>There was a yank then and the benign old cow turned into a crazed bull, sucking her arm up between its jaws.<br><br>A flash fire of shock and pain exploded at Violet&#x2019;s elbow joint and in her brain, and just as red hot was her outrage: But it&#x2019;s my birthday!<br><br>RaeAnn, who was next to Violet on the floor, screamed, and Polly Ball, the only woman on the floor to have gone to college (she would have graduated from UNC-Raleigh with a degree in art history had she not been summoned home after her father died), thought: that&#x2019;s the scream in the Edvard Munch painting.<br><br>Violet too heard the scream even as she fainted, even as the weight of her falling body helped further tear skin from skin and bone from bone. When she woke up in the hospital, her stub-arm wrapped and bleeding like a rump roast in butcher&#x2019;s paper, the screaming was still inside her head&#x2014;was in her head for more years than she cared to count.<br><br>When the morphine curtain lifted on her consciouness, her first thought was: some sweet sixteenth.<br><br>Violet should have known better; in her short history she had learned that expectations only deepened the disappointment that inevitably stained every special occasion&#x2014;not that many were celebrated. In excavating her mind for memories of parties and presents, she&#x2019;d only been able to dig up those concerning her sixth birthday, when her mother baked her a yellow cake iced with raspberry jelly and gave her a real present to unwrap. It was a rag doll Violet immediately christened Jellycakes, commemorating what she told her mother was &#x201c;the best birthday cake and the best birthday doll ever ever ever ever made.&#x201d;<br><br>The remembrance of that lone celebration was ruined by what her mother did three days later, which was to run off with the pharmacist from Henson Drugs. Considering her robust good health, Erlene spent a lot of time at the pharmacy window; every other customer walked away tucking green or brown bottles of tonics and pills and elixirs into their purses or pockets, but all her mama left the drugstore with was a flushed face and a soft dreamy look in her eyes. Violet liked Mr. Gladstone, the pharmacist&#x2014;he gave her root-beer barrels, and once a Henson&#x2019;s Drugs (&#x201c;For All Your Drug &amp; Sundries Needs&#x201d;) calendar with a picture of a kitten on it&#x2014;but after he robbed her of her mother, Violet came to think of the druggist as the criminal he was; a man guilty of grand theft. She was a child at the time of the crime, hadn&#x2019;t even started the first grade yet. Ten years later, when Violet lost her arm, it occurred to her that this was not her first amputation, but her second.<br><br>Later, when she came to know how love can slam reason and responsibility to the mat as easily as a heavyweight takes down a bantam, Violet forgave her mother for running off (Yarby Gladstone did have nice clean hands, after all, and an entire set of teeth, or at least all of the ones that showed in a smile), but she never forgave Erlene for forgetting about her, for never sending a letter or postcard, for never sending for her. Mothers who disappear off the face of the earth leave their children feeling as if they&#x2019;ve disappeared too; disappeared from everything they thought was certain and safe and true. Abandonment can be crueler to a child than death; Violet would rather her mama had died because at least a grave would have given her a place to visit, something to touch, something to talk to.<br>There were few people in Mount Crawford, Kentucky, surprised by the young Mrs. Mathers taking a permanent leave of absence; it didn&#x2019;t take any great power of observation to see that Violet&#x2019;s parents were as mismatched as a crow and a canary. Judd Mathers was Erlene&#x2019;s senior by fifteen years and had always looked older than his age; he was not yet forty when his wife left, and yet his long thin face was as creased as a bloodhound&#x2019;s, his black hair leeched to a lusterless gray. He was one of those men hobbled by his inability to exercise his emotions (except for anger), although Violet thought that in his stunted capacity, he really loved his wife. She remembered him smiling at her mama&#x2019;s jokes, watching Erlene with a shy delight when she put the corn bread on the table, crowing, &#x201c;Ta-da!&#x201d; or when she hung the clothes out on the line, grabbing his union suit and pretending to waltz with it.<br><br>What registered most on the young Mrs. Mathers&#x2019;s face when she looked at her husband was disbelief and impatience, as if she were always asking herself, &#x201c;How did I get here?&#x201d; and &#x201c;How soon can I leave?&#x201d; Had she not gone and got herself pregnant, Erlene would have laughed out loud at Judd&#x2019;s marriage proposal, would have swatted it away as if it was a black and pesky fly.<br><br>There was a certain flightiness to her mama that, even as a child, Violet recognized. The young (she was only eighteen when Violet was born), trim woman could be in the middle of kneading dough when she&#x2019;d wipe her hands on the dish towel and dash out of the back door, calling out that she was going to town to see what was playing at the picture show, and would Violet mind punching down the bread when it rose? The little girl longed to chase after her but had learned early on that she was usually included in those things from which Erlene needed to escape. When her mother was in an affectionate mood, she might invite Violet onto her lap, but it wasn&#x2019;t long before the girl would be flung off, as Erlene would be distracted by chores or a sudden need to manicure her nails, to wave-set her hair, or dance to the crystal radio in the boxy little room she called the parlor.<br><br>Erlene was full of fun ideas&#x2014;&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s pick raspberries and have a picnic on Mount Crawford!&#x201d; &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s throw a tea party on the porch!&#x201d;&#x2014;and once or twice these ideas blossomed into reality, but most always Violet would be left waiting on the crumbling front steps, her eagerness bright as a balloon and just as sure to deflate. The bulk of memories concerning her mother were those in which Erlene stood her up (indoctrinating Violet early on into the sorry club of wallflowerhood), and yet the little girl believed her mama when she called her her &#x201c;precious flower,&#x201d; clung to those rare terms of endearment, knowing they were proof of her love.<br><br>Violet made all sorts of excuses for her, but in her deep heart she knew that mothers who loved their precious flowers didn&#x2019;t leave them to grow up in a musty old house on the edge of town with a father whose personality vacillated between melancholia and meanness; surely Erlene knew how that would make a precious flower wither up and die?<br><br>Violet. It didn&#x2019;t take long for everyone to see that the child had been misnamed.<br><br>&#x201c;Gawd Almighty,&#x201d; Uncle Maynard said the first time he saw her, &#x201c;she&#x2019;s homelier than Tate Seevers!&#x201d;<br><br>(Tate Seevers was the one-eyed World War I vet who lived in a shack outside the junkyard with his half-wolf dog.)<br><br>Uncle Clyde nodded. &#x201c;Yuh, I reckon you&#x2019;ll see prettier faces in a horse barn.&#x201d;<br><br>These stories were gleefully told to Violet by her cousin Byron, who seemed to have an endless collection.<br><br>&#x201c;My mama says only people with hexes on &#x2019;em got faces like yours.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I heard your daddy says the only way you&#x2019;re ever gonna get a boyfriend is if he sends you to a school for the blind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sit up, Violet, speak! Good dog.&#x201d;<br><br>The Matherses&#x2019; back porch was the local speakeasy for Judd and his brothers-in-law, who&#x2019;d congregate there to drink the corn liquor Uncle Maynard showed some talent at making; but after Erlene left, her brothers never came around.

He currently lives in Los Angeles.<p><b>Keys to the Character</b></p><p><b>A</b>t first it may seem strange that a man who is clearly dishonest, disloyal, and has no interest in marriage would have any appeal to a woman. But throughout all of history, and in all cultures, this type has had a fatal effect. What the Rake offers is what society normally does not allow women: an affair of pure pleasure, an exciting brush with danger. A woman is often deeply oppressed by the role she is expected to play. She is supposed to be the tender, civilizing force in society, and to want commitment and lifelong loyalty. But often her marriages and relationships give her not romance and devotion but routine and an endlessly distracted mate. It remains an abiding female fantasy to meet a man who gives totally of himself, who lives for her, even if only for a while.</p><p>This dark, repressed side of female desire found expression in the legend of Don Juan. At first the legend was a male fantasy: the adventurous knight who could have any woman he wanted. But in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Don Juan slowly evolved from the masculine adventurer to a more feminized version: a man who lived only for women. This evolution came from women&#x2019;s interest in the story, and was a result of their frustrated desires. Marriage for them was a form of indentured servitude; but Don Juan offered pleasure for its own sake, desire with no strings attached. For the time he crossed your path, you were all he thought about. His desire for you was so powerful that he gave you no time to think or to worry about the consequences. He would come in the night, give you an unforgettable moment, and then vanish. He might have conquered a thousand women before you, but that only made him more interesting; better to be abandoned than undesired by such a man.</p><p>The great seducers do not offer the mild pleasures that society condones. They touch a person&#x2019;s unconscious, those repressed desires that cry out for liberation. Do not imagine that women are the tender creatures that some people would like them to be. Like men, they are deeply attracted to the forbidden, the dangerous, even the slightly evil. (Don Juan ends by going to hell, and the word &#x201c;rake&#x201d; comes from &#x201c;rakehell,&#x201d; a man who rakes the coals of hell; the devilish component, clearly, is an important part of the fantasy) Always remember: if you are to play the Rake, you must convey a sense of risk and darkness, suggesting to your victim that she is participating in something rare and thrilling&#x2014;a chance to play out her own rakish desires.</p><p>To play the Rake, the most obvious requirement is the ability to let yourself go, to draw a woman into the kind of purely sensual moment in which past and future lose meaning. You must be able to abandon yourself to the moment. (When the Rake Valmont&#x2014;a character modeled after the Duke de Richelieu&#x2014;in Laclos&#x2019; eighteenth-century novel <i>Dangerous Liaisons</i> writes letters that are obviously calculated to have a certain effect on his chosen victim, Madame de Tourvel, she sees right through them; but when his letters really do burn with passion, she begins to relent.) An added benefit of this quality is that it makes you seem unable to control yourself, a display of weakness that a woman enjoys. By abandoning yourself to the seduced, you make them feel that you exist for them alone&#x2014;a feeling reflecting a truth, though a temporary one. Of the hundreds of women that Pablo Picasso, consummate rake, seduced over the years, most of them had the feeling that they were the only one he truly loved.</p><p>The Rake never worries about a woman&#x2019;s resistance to him, or for that matter about any other obstacle in his path&#x2014;a husband, a physical barrier. Resistance is only the spur to his desire, enflaming him all the more. When Picasso was seducing Fran�oise Gilot, in fact, he begged her to resist; he needed resistance to add to the thrill. In any case, an obstacle in your way gives you the opportunity to prove yourself, and the creativity you bring to matters of love. In the eleventh-century Japanese novel <i>The Tale</i> <i>of Genji,</i>by the court lady Murasaki Shikibu, the Rake Prince Niou is not disturbed by the sudden disappearance of Ukifune, the woman he loves. She has fled because although she is interested in the prince, she is in love with another man; but her absence allows the prince to go to extreme lengths to track her down. His sudden appearance to whisk her away to a house deep in the woods, and the gallantry he displays in doing so, overwhelm her. Remember : if no resistances or obstacles face you, you must create them. No seduction can proceed without them.</p><p>The Rake is an extreme personality. Impudent, sarcastic, and bitingly witty, he cares nothing for what anyone thinks. Paradoxically, this only makes him more seductive. In the courtlike atmosphere of studio-era Hollywood, when most of the actors behaved like dutiful sheep, the great Rake Errol Flynn stood out in his insolence. He defied the studio chiefs, engaged in the most extreme pranks, reveled in his reputation as Hollywood&#x2019;s supreme seducer&#x2014;all of which enhanced his popularity. The Rake needs a backdrop of convention&#x2014;a stultified court, a humdrum marriage, a conservative culture&#x2014;to shine, to be appreciated for the breath of fresh air he provides. Never worry about going too far: the Rake&#x2019;s essence is that he goes further than anyone else.</p><p>When the Earl of Rochester, seventeenth-century England&#x2019;s most notorious Rake and poet, abducted Elizabeth Malet, one of the most sought-after young ladies of the court, he was duly punished. But lo and behold, a few years later young Elizabeth, though wooed by the most eligible bachelors in the country, chose Rochester to be her husband. In demonstrating his audacious desire, he made himself stand out from the crowd.</p><p>Related to the Rake&#x2019;s extremism is the sense of danger, taboo, perhaps even the hint of cruelty about him. This was the appeal of another poet Rake, one of the greatest in history: Lord Byron. Byron disliked any kind of convention, and happily played this up. When he had an affair with his half sister, who bore a child by him, he made sure that all of England knew about it. He could be uncommonly cruel, as he was to his wife. But all of this only made him that much more desirable. Danger and taboo appeal to a repressed side in women, who are supposed to represent a civilizing, moralizing force in culture. Just as a man may fall victim to the Siren through his desire to be free of his sense of masculine responsibility, a woman may succumb to the Rake through her yearning to be free of the constraints of virtue and decency. Indeed it is often the most virtuous woman who falls most deeply in love with the Rake.</p><p>Among the Rake&#x2019;s most seductive qualities is his ability to make women want to reform him. How many thought they would be the one to tame Lord Byron; how many of Picasso&#x2019;s women thought they would finally be the one with whom he would spend the rest of his life. You must exploit this tendency to the fullest. When caught red-handed in rakishness, fall back on your weakness&#x2014;your desire to change, and your inability to do so. With so many women at your feet, what can you do? You are the one who is the victim. You need help. Women will jump at this opportunity; they are uncommonly indulgent of the Rake, for he is such a pleasant, dashing figure. The desire to reform him disguises the true nature of their desire, the secret thrill they get from him. When President Bill Clinton was clearly caught out as a Rake, it was women who rushed to his defense, finding every possible excuse for him. The fact that the Rake is so devoted to women, in his own strange way, makes him lovable and seductive to them.</p><p>Finally, a Rake&#x2019;s greatest asset is his reputation. Never downplay your bad name, or seem to apologize for it. Instead, embrace it, enhance it. It is what draws women to you. There are several things you must be known for: your irresistible attractiveness to women; your uncontrollable devotion to pleasure (this will make you seem weak, but also exciting to be around); your disdain for convention; a rebellious streak that makes you seem dangerous. This last element can be slightly hidden; on the surface, be polite and civil, while letting it be known that behind the scenes you are incorrigible. Duke de Richelieu made his conquests as public as possible, exciting other women&#x2019;s competitive desire to join the club of the seduced. It was by reputation that Lord Byron attracted his willing victims. A woman may feel ambivalent about President Clinton&#x2019;s reputation, but beneath that ambivalence is an underlying interest. Do not leave your reputation to chance or gossip; it is your life&#x2019;s artwork, and you must craft it, hone it, and display it with the care of an artist.</p><p><i><b>Symbol:</b> Fire.</i></p><p><i>The Rake burns with a desire that</i> <i>enflames the woman he is seducing. It is</i> <i>extreme, uncontrollable, and dangerous. The Rake may</i> <i>end in hell, but the flames surrounding him often</i> <i>make</i> <i>him seem that much more desirable to women.</i></p><p><b>Dangers</b></p><p><b>L</b>ike the Siren, the Rake faces the most danger from members of his own sex, who are far less indulgent than women are of his constant skirt chasing. In the old days, a Rake was often an aristocrat, and no matter how many people he offended or even killed, in the end he would go unpunished. Today, only stars and the very wealthy can play the Rake with impunity; the rest of us need to be careful.</p><p>Elvis Presley had been a shy young man. Attaining early stardom, and seeing the power it gave him over women, he went berserk, becoming a Rake almost overnight. Like many Rakes, Elvis had a predilection for women who were already taken. He found himself cornered by an angry husband or boyfriend on numerous occasions, and came away with a few cuts and bruises. This might seem to suggest that you should step lightly around husbands and boyfriends, especially early on in your career. But the charm of the Rake is that such dangers don&#x2019;t matter to them. You cannot be a Rake by being fearful and prudent; the occasional pummeling is part of the game. Later on, in any case, at the height of Elvis&#x2019;s fame, no husband would dare touch him.</p><p>The greater danger for the Rake comes not from the violently offended husband but from those insecure men who feel threatened by the Don Juan figure. Although they will not admit it, they envy the Rake&#x2019;s life of pleasure, and like everyone envious, they will attack in hidden ways, often masking their persecutions as morality. The Rake may find his career endangered by such men (or by the occasional woman who is equally insecure, and who feels hurt because the Rake does not want her). There is little the Rake can do to avoid envy; if everyone was as successful in seduction, society would not function.</p><p>So accept envy as a badge of honor. Don&#x2019;t be naive, be aware. When attacked by a moralist persecutor, do not be taken in by their crusade; it is motivated by envy, pure and simple. You can blunt it by being less of a Rake, asking forgiveness, claiming to have reformed, but this will damage your reputation, making you seem less lovably rakish. In the end, it is better to suffer attacks with dignity and keep on seducing. Seduction is the source of your power; and you can always count on the infinite indulgence of women.</p><p><b>the Ideal lover</b></p><p><i>Most</i> <i>people have dreams in their</i> <i>youth that get shattered or worn</i> <i>down with age.

[This book] exposes the consistency and coherence of the seemingly unrelated episodes of Manhattan&#39;s urbanism; it is an interpretation that establishes Manhattan as the product of an unformulated movement, &#39;Manhattanism&#39;, whose true program was so outrageous that in order for it to be realized, it could never be openly declared. &#39;Delirious in New York&#39; is the retroactive manifesto of Manhattan&#39;s architectural enterprise; it untangles the theories, tactics and dissimulations that allowed New York&#39;s architects to establish the desires of Manhattan&#39;s collective unconscious as realities in the Grid. It proves above all, that Manhattan has been, from the beginning, devoted to the most rational, efficient and utilitarian pursuit of the irrational. In this vision Coney Island becomes an embryonic Manhattan, testbed of a Technology of the Fantastic, the Skyscraper a self-contained universe, Manhattan a man-made archipelago of architectural islands, Rockefeller Center the first and last fragment of a definitive Manhattan. The decline of this movement sets in with the European Modernist Blitzkrieg unleashed by Le Corbusier in the mid-thirties. An appendix presents a series of projects that announce the &#39;second coming&#39; of Manhattanism, this time as an explicit doctrine that can claim its place among contemporary urbanisms. An impressive documentation of original materials and unpublished projects provides the evidence for this architectural manifesto, which reads, in its insistent tracing of subconscious clues and themes, like a psychological thriller.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Everybody&#39;s Wokking</h2><p>Provides recipes for appetizers, soups, seafood, poultry, meat, vegetables, and more that can be prepared in a wok</p><p>Recipes from the latest installment of the author's PBS series, Yan Can Cook , which began earlier this month.

In a world filled with technology designed to help us enjoy more leisure time, many of us still forsake the simple joys&#x2014;going to the movies, having lunch with girlfriends, reading novels&#x2014;in order to take care of our stepfamilies. Very quickly after marrying our partners, too many of us have crossed the fine line into emotional imbalance by working too hard and becoming involved in situations where we receive little joy or reward. We are suddenly in deep water without a life jacket to keep us afloat.<br><br>Little guidance is available about the challenges we face&#x2014;being a stepmother is truly a "forgotten" role in society. Have you ever complained about the problems you are having as a stepmother, and heard the comment: "Well, you knew he had kids when you married him"? Unfortunately, this is a statement that too many of us hear all too often.<br><br>Second marriages can be difficult in themselves, with or without stepchildren. Add children into the mix, and the situation is that much more complicated!<br><br><strong>Why Are So Many of Us Having So Much Trouble?</strong><br><br>As you might expect, the reasons for stepfamily problems are complex. One contributing factor is that many of us are just not prepared for this role and have no idea how demanding the job can be. Many of the respondents to the online questionnaire said that they simply had no concept of the depth and breadth of the problems they would encounter once married.<br><br>For many of us, affection for our new partners makes us turn a blind eye to potential problems down the road. We simply hope that our love will get us through. While most women understand that marrying a man with children won't be as easy as marrying a man without children, conventional wisdom suggests that time will help "blend" family members into a cohesive unit. We are led to believe that, eventually, stepchildren will grow to love and respect us, partners will overcome their guilt for hurting their children, and ex-wives will get over their anger and resentment. Even for those of us with prior experience&#x2014;having been a stepmother in a previous relationship or having had a stepmother&#x2014;this knowledge may not be of much use in our current situations.<br><br>Problems can take months or years to develop in stepfamilies. Consequently, many of us are bound to be unprepared for the challenges we face, and are overwhelmed by their magnitude when they do occur.<br><br>Other stepmothers said that they <em>were </em>aware of potential problems in their stepfamilies, but they believed those difficulties would improve as everyone adjusted to the new family dynamic. Unfortunately, they were usually just plain wrong&#x2014;the problems did not diminish. In fact, for many, the problems grew. Rather than improving, without intervention, stepfamily life tends to deteriorate or remain static over time.<br><br>There is a small group of women who did not know about their stepchildren when they got involved with, or married, their partners. Now that paternity tests are widely available, some women have discovered they were stepmothers months or years after they got married. Needless to say, these surprised stepmoms experienced a host of emotions, including shock and anger, when introduced to children they had no idea existed.<br><br>The conversations in the Steps for Stepmothers online chat room are powerful illustrations of the problems we as stepmothers experience and, to a large extent, these conversations have shaped my thinking about being a stepmother. Even the usernames on the message board are poignant. Many of these monikers, such as "Worn Out," "Want to Be Happy," "Stressed to the Max," and "At Wit's End" are vivid shorthand expressions of the painful experiences of these women.<br><br>Many of the stepmothers I have worked with in my psychotherapy practice have also felt unappreciated, overburdened and misunderstood by their families and communities. Before contacting me, many of these women had suffered in silence, for fear of being judged or ostracized, until their situations finally became intolerable.<br><br>There is a wide variety of problems that can make our lives as stepmothers miserable. Many stepmothers find that their partners act more like pals to their children than like fathers, with the result that stepchildren are undisciplined and spoiled. Some partners are afraid to set guidelines for their children to follow, along with appropriate consequences if those guidelines are ignored. Partners fear that if they are strict, their children will no longer be willing to spend time with them. To keep this from happening, they remain passive when their children act up. It is both difficult for stepmothers to witness and experience a child's misbehavior, and frustrating when they cannot get partners to understand the need to take corrective parental action. Other stepmothers must deal with intrusive, difficult ex-wives, who disrupt their households by calling at inappropriate times, change scheduled dropoffs and pickups at the last minute, and bad-mouth us to their children.<br><br>Many of us sadly realize that our attempts to bond with our stepchildren have failed, and we are left feeling ignored and disrespected. Some of us grow weary of dealing with stepchildren who seem unappreciative, uncooperative or spoiled. Some of us feel we have limited authority in our own households, because many decisions are made without our input or consent. Some of us&#x2014;an unfortunate few&#x2014;get to deal with <em>all </em>the above situations, and maybe more.<br><br><strong>Would You Do It Again?</strong><br><br>"If you knew what your life would be like as a stepmother, would you get involved with your partner again?" Stepmothers often ask this of each other in the online chat room, and I also asked this question in my survey. For many who responded to the survey, the answer was an unequivocal no. At times, do you also regret your decision to get involved with or to marry to your partner? To help you answer this question, consider the following:<br><br><strong>Indications of Potential Problems</strong><br><br>&#x25a0;&nbsp; &nbsp;You feel frustrated, aggravated, annoyed or angry about your stepfamily, and don't have appropriate outlets to deal with these negative feelings.<br><br>&#x25a0;&nbsp; &nbsp;You feel insecure about your place in the stepfamily.

While you may not be able to solve all the problems in your step-family, you can change the way you deal with them, making your life more satisfying and content.

But there aren&#x2019;t many important goalies. And Jacques Plante was an important goalie.&#x201d; Ken Dryden<br><br>On and off the ice Jacques Plante was a true original; he was extremely talented, boastful, defiant, mysterious, and complex. Throughout his tumultuous career as a goalie, he played for Montreal, New York, St. Louis, Toronto, Boston, and Edmonton. His contributions to and impact on the game were extensive and are reflected in today&#x2019;s rules, equipment, and style of play. Thoroughly investigated through archival and primary research, and including interviews with figures such as Jean B�liveau, Henri Richard, Dickie Moore, and Scotty Bowman, this biography sheds light on one of the most pivotal figures in the history of hockey.</p><p>A member of the Society for International Hockey Research, Todd Denault is a freelance writer who has had his work featured in numerous online and print publications. A graduate of Carleton University and Lakehead University, Todd resides in Cobourg, Ontario. This is his first book.<b>THE SEEDS OF THE MAN<br></b>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Located on the Saint-Maurice River, almost halfway between Montreal and Quebec City, at the turn of the century Shawinigan Falls (as it was known then; in 1958, the city dropped the Falls from its name) was a thriving town that was the first in the country to produce aluminum and employed thousands in the pulp and paper, chemical, and textile industries.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the 1930s, with the onset of the Depression, many of those factory jobs disappeared under the weight of the economic downturn. In an effort to help families hit by the loss of employment, the city council enacted a variety of public works programs that included building a hockey arena.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bolstered by their new arena, Shawinigan was granted a franchise in the nascent Quebec Senior Hockey League in the fall of 1945. A semi-professional league that operated in the area between the junior league and the National Hockey League, the QSHL, then made up of seven franchises, produced a high quality of hockey that gave many players overlooked by the professionals a chance to continue playing for money while keeping their NHL dreams alive. Overnight, the Cataractes became the toast of the town, a source of civic pride, and gave the youngsters a team of players to idolize.<br>&nbsp;<br>That same fall, a teenage boy, full of dreams and self-assurance, stood in front of the newly built arena and asked if the Cataractes needed any help.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I was standing outside the door of the rink in the Shawinigan Arena where the Shawinigan team in the Quebec Senior Hockey League played its home games," remembered Jacques Plante many years later. "I noticed that they had only one practice goalie and asked the trainer whether I could help out. Although I was fifteen years old by this time, he told me to 'go away. You're still wearing a diaper.'"<br>&nbsp;<br>The name of that condescending trainer has been lost to history. What this trainer had no way of knowing was that in fifty years this young man's name would be emblazoned over the door when the arena was named in his honour.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jacques, the oldest child of Xavier and Palma Plante, was born in a wooden farmhouse near Mont Carmel in Mauricie, Quebec, on January 17, 1929. Soon afterwards, Xavier moved with his wife and baby to Shawinigan Falls, where he had secured employment with the Aluminum Company of Canada Limited.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Dad was a machinist who had to work hard &#x2013; harder than any man I have ever known," Jacques later said. "He even got a temporary job during his holidays while working for the aluminum company &#x2013; just to raise a bit more money. He had a bicycle to get him to and from work, two miles each way. I can't recall him taking a single day off. Whenever I won an award in the NHL, I thought of my father and the pride he would get in reading about it and having people mention it to him."<br>&nbsp;<br>Jacques was not an only child for long. Over the next thirteen years, he would be joined by five brothers and five sisters. With a burgeoning family, Palma Plante found her time at a premium, so as they got older each of the children was expected to help with the household chores. Being the oldest in such a large family meant that Jacques was given responsibilities rare for many his age. His chores included scrubbing floors, cooking, and changing diapers. With not much in the way of extra money, most of the children's clothing was handmade, and Jacques became proficient with a needle, some thread, and yarn. These were skills he carried into his adulthood and contributed to his legend.<br>&nbsp;<br>With such a big brood and only one income, everyone in the Plante house was required to sacrifice some of the things that others better off were able to enjoy. This was most apparent to little Jacques in the hot summer months, when he was allowed to wear shoes only for Sunday Mass or the odd special event. Most times he went barefoot.<br>&nbsp;<br>"The shoes proved everything is relative," Plante wrote later. "All of us kids in the neighbourhood had to go shoeless for the same reason &#x2013; all except the landlord's son, because his father had more income."<br>&nbsp;<br>Years later, when his hockey career had taken him away from his impoverished beginnings, many teammates as well as members of the press were taken aback by Plante's habit of knitting his own undershirts, socks, toques, and scarves. But he would always speak with pride of his ability to knit a pair of socks in a day and a toque in a mere three and a half hours. Throughout his life, Plante used knitting as a form of relaxation, oblivious to the reaction of those around him; this was his way to unwind after being the target of onrushing pucks. However, typical of the man, there was also a practical side to his needlework.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I can't get what I want in the stores," Plante explained of his choice in undergarments, "so I knit [them]. I use four-ply wool. They must not be too warm. I use larger needles because small ones produce a thicker weaving and the holes are too small."<br>&nbsp;<br>As an adult, Jacques Plante was misunderstood by many around him. They questioned why he continued to knit, why he was so frugal with his money, and why he kept his distance from those closest to him. The answers to many of these questions lay in his childhood.<br>&nbsp;<br>"He grew up poor and was very proud of it," explains sportswriter Frank Orr. "He learned a lot of good lessons from it. He was deprived because there was no money around, but it taught Jacques the value of a dollar."<br>&nbsp;<br>"He was very careful with money," confirms his former teammate Dickie Moore. "He came up poor and he grew up the right way. He didn't spend what he didn't have and he saved what he had. I admired him for that &#x2013; he was an individual. There's a reason he kept his money. He wanted to end up with something, and that's what he did."<br>&nbsp;<br>Plante never forgot his impoverished roots. It's what drove him, what motivated him to always reach higher. It instilled in him selfconfidence, and a belief that he alone could shape his destiny. And despite the poverty, Plante always retained a certain fondness for his childhood.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the early 1970s, when Plante was plying his trade with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Frank Orr, a writer with the <i>Toronto Star</i>, was commissioned by his editor to write a special Christmas column. Orr was given the assignment of asking each player to share a remembrance of their most cherished Christmas memories.<br>&nbsp;<br>Plante told Orr how his father would buy two bottles of ginger ale on his way home from work every Christmas Eve. This was the only day when the Plante children would taste a carbonated beverage.<br>&nbsp;<br>"We'd have soft drinks then and I can still taste them," Plante told Orr. "Would you believe that the champagne I have drank on six occasions out of the Stanley Cup didn't have the same tang? Being poor doesn't necessarily mean no enjoyment from life."<br>&nbsp;<br>Another source of enjoyment for young Jacques was the outdoors. He and his friends played games at every spare moment, whether during recess at school or on the weekends. Sports provided an escape from hard reality.<br>&nbsp;<br>Baseball was extremely popular with many, and Plante always felt that this may have been the sport he was best at. But for any child growing up in Quebec at that time, all other sports took a back seat to one overriding passion: hockey.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jacques Plante couldn't tell you when he began playing hockey. He was told by others that he started playing a form of the game, with a ball and without skates, at the age of three, the same age he learned to skate. "Growing up, Shawinigan was a big hockey town," recalls Marcel Pronovost, a childhood friend of Plante's. "We organized and managed a lot of the games ourselves. In all the schools we had an hour and a half for lunch and every class had a team and we played at noon. Every school had an outdoor ice rink then."<br>&nbsp;<br>Like most children, Jacques was naturally curious about goaltending, but he quickly discovered that a frozen tennis ball hurt, and that a puck hurt even more. Besides, he found that he had an affinity for skating.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then at the tender age of five, something happened that would forever alter Jacques' path in life. He was climbing up the ladder of the playground slide when suddenly he lost his balance and fell hard to the ground, breaking his left wrist. However, the real damage took place in the ensuing weeks and months when the wrist didn't heal properly, leaving Jacques unable to turn his left palm outward, which made it especially difficult to catch pucks.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jacques had quickly fallen in love with the game of hockey. He enjoyed skating, but when he skated hard, he had trouble getting his breath. He was soon diagnosed as being asthmatic. Unlike his wrist, which was surgically healed decades later, asthma was a constant companion throughout his life.<br>&nbsp;<br>"If it wasn't for my asthma," Jacques said later, "I would certainly have remained on defence and possibly never gotten beyond school hockey."<br>&nbsp;<br>When it became clear that Jacques had no choice but to play in net &#x2013; where no fast skating was required &#x2013; his supportive father presented his five-year-old son with his first goal stick, carved from a big tree root. When he was seven, his father bought him a proper goalie stick for Christmas. That same year, Xavier stuffed potato sacks into wooden panels to give Jacques his first set of goalie pads.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was during these early days spent outdoors that Jacques developed one of his most enduring trademarks. Standing alone in the net in those bitterly cold winters, bare-faced and bare-headed, Jacques soon found himself frantically knitting toques to cover his frostbitten ears. The toque would become a staple and would be worn indoors and outdoors right up until his professional debut.<br>&nbsp;<br>During this time Plante also discovered that he didn't always fit in with the other children. "Looking back I know it began when my fat...</p><h2>Simply Delicious, The Costco Way (The Costco Way)</h2><p>Simply Delicious, The Costco Way.

His portrayal of the Soviet Union as an unfree society, one where each individual becomes a small cell in a vast organism, is devastating and convincing. A Sorbonne instructor who coauthored Utopia in Power, Heller insists that the Soviet state's overriding goal is the same as it was under Lenin and Stalin: shaping "human raw material" into obedient, passive cogs in a machine. Today in the U.S.S.R., he notes, all references to the Bible and the Jewish people have been removed from school texts; women do the heaviest physical work and bear most of the family's burdens but have practically no voice; men act as capricious boys, working off their feelings of powerlessness by abusing their wives. Heller's surprising expose of Gorbachev's touched-up Stalinist vocabulary is brilliant.

In 'Typhoon' Conrad reveals, in the steadfast courage of an undemonstrative captain and the imaginative readiness of his young first mate, the differences between instinct and intelligence in a partnership vital to human survival. 'Falk', the companion sea-story, contrasts, as Conrad once put it, 'common sentimentalism with the frank standpoint of a more or less primitive man', a man with a conscience, however, about the girl he desires. In one of the 'land-stories' Conrad explores the utter isolation of an East European emigrant in England; in the other, the plight of a woman ironically trapped by the unwitting alliance of two retired widowers - each blind in his own way.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

In "Typhoon," a storm upends a captain's complacency, hurling him and his crew into a terrifying battle with nature. "Amy Foster" tells the story of an Eastern European immigrant shipwrecked off the coast of England, and his ultimately doomed love affair with the dim-witted Amy Foster. In "Falk," the protagonist harbors a terrible secret that inhibits his ability to confront the woman he loves and find the wife he longs for. And in "Tomorrow," the son of a retired sea captain, who has been waiting years for his boy to come home, finally returns, but only because he is destitute and needs money.&#x201c;My own conviction, sweeping all those reaches of living fiction I know, is that Conrad&#x2019;s figure stands out from the field like the Alps from the Piedmont plain.&#x201d; &#x2014;H.

Tour.</p><p>Ron Davis, author of The Gift of Dyslexia, grew up &#34;retarded&#34; (what would today be called autistic) until his early teens. Even though he failed miserably in the school system, he later took technical courses and became a successful engineer, businessman and artist. He was functionally illiterate until age 38 when he discovered how to mentally orient his perceptions. After that, he dedicated his life to helping people with the gift of dyslexia achieve literacy and self-esteem.Levinson's use of patient testimonials and case studies to describe his breakthroughs in the treatment of dyslexia makes for a medical text that reads like a novel. He traces both his research on the connection between dyslexia and the inner ear and cerebellum and also the scientific community's skepticism regarding his claims. Formerly a professor at New York University Medical School and currently director of the Medical Dyslexic Treatment Center, Levinson acknowledges criticism and errors and, overall, offers a balanced view of his methods. In the process, he reveals the unfortunate increase in the politics of scientific research. Levinson's book is recommended as a source for the most current research, an account of the patients' plight, and an expose of the scientific debate. Davis, on the other hand, emphasizes child development, psychology, and education rather than medical treatment. As a dyslexic individual and a teacher, he offers a unique perspective on the subject of learning disabilities. Through his own real-life experiences he shares what everyone needs to know about dyslexia, what the dyslexic student encounters in a typical school, and what is needed to teach such students effectively. To support his conclusion that dyslexics have special talents of perception, imagination, and intuition, Davis cites talented and brilliant figures from Einstein and Leonardo da Vinci to Churchill and Walt Disney. He concludes with a test, written in simple language and printed in a large typeface to make it easier to read. Given Levinson's medical focus, his text is recommended for academic and larger public libraries, while Davis's book is appropriate for all types of libraries.<br><i>Samuel T.

Delany began to sweep up what would eventually exceed a million readers with his tale of Bellona, a city at the center of the United States, shaken by a catastrophe that has unhinged the very structure of reality. Skies darkened by smoke from burning buildings, population reduced to youth gangs, drifters, prophets, and perverts, Bellona is a city where a young man known only as the Kid - poet, lover, and finally a leader of the volatile &#34;scorpions&#34; - tries to create a life for himself and those around him in a landscape where two moons can suddenly shine through the night clouds or a sun thousands of times larger than any ever seen before may rise - and set - in a day. Dhalgren is a novel that interrogates a range of inchoately American oppositions: black and white, male and female, gay and straight, sane and mad.</p><p>What is <i>Dhalgren</i>? <i>Dhalgren</i> is one of the greatest novels of 20th-century American literature. <i>Dhalgren</i> is one of the all-time bestselling science fiction novels. <i>Dhalgren</i> may be read with equal validity as SF, magic realism, or metafiction. <i>Dhalgren</i> is controversial, challenging, and scandalous. <i>Dhalgren</i> is a brilliant novel about sex, gender, race, class, art, and identity.<p> A mysterious disaster has stricken the midwestern American city of Bellona, and its aftereffects are disturbing: a city block burns down and is intact a week later; clouds cover the sky for weeks, then part to reveal two moons; a week passes for one person when only a day passes for another. The catastrophe is confined to Bellona, and most of the inhabitants have fled. But others are drawn to the devastated city, among them the Kid, a white/American Indian man who can't remember his own name. The Kid is emblematic of those who live in the new Bellona, who are the young, the poor, the mad, the violent, the outcast--the marginalized.</p><p> <i>Dhalgren</i> is many things, but instantly accessible isn't one of them. While most of this big, ambitious, deeply detailed novel is beautifully pellucid, the opening pages will be difficult for some: the novel starts with the second half of an incomplete sentence, in the viewpoint of a man who doesn't know who he is. If you find the early pages rough going, push on; the story soon becomes clear and fascinating. But--fair warning--the central nature of the disaster, of its strange devastations and disruptions, remains a puzzle for many readers, sometimes after several readings.</p><p> Spoiler warning: If you want to figure out the secret of the novel as you read <i>Dhalgren</i>, then stop reading this review right now! If you want to know the secret before you start, this is what the novel is about: the experience of existence inside a novel. Time passes differently for different characters. A river changes location. Stairs change their number. The Kid looks in a mirror and sees not himself, but someone who looks an awful lot like Samuel R. Delany. Central images include mirrors, lenses, and prisms, devices that focus, reflect--and distort. The Kid fills a notebook with a journal that may be <i>Dhalgren</i>, and is uncertain if he has written much, or any, of it. The characters don't know they're in a novel, but they know something is wrong. <i>Dhalgren</i> explores the relationship between characters and author (or, perhaps, characters, "author," and author).</p><p> The final chapter can be even tougher going than the opening pages, with its viewpoint change and its stretches of braided narrative--and the novel ends with the beginning of an unfinished sentence. But the last chapter becomes clear as you persevere; and when you get to that unfinished closing line, turn to the first line of the novel to finish the sentence and close the narrative circle. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>5 1/4 x 8 1/2 trim.

LC 85-51749. $29.95. art These two collaborative books have been produced for our delectation in anticipation of Henry Moore's 88th birthday on July 30th. His works are rooted in the earth and spring from a spiritual soil accessible to all of us; they speak to us directly in a mythic language. In Henry Moore , the strength, power, and mystery of his works and surroundings are lovingly and lucidly presented in the artist's own words, by archival photos, and by photographs taken by his longtime friend, John Hedgecoe. This is a wonderful book, fully expressing the essence of Moore's title page statement: "I would like my work to be thought of as a celebration of life and nature." The collaborative effort of Spender, Finn, and Moore's wife, Irina, has produced a gentler book. While the impact and appeal of many of Finn's color photographs are marred by the annoying and distracting placement of page numbers in black squares, the book as a whole is successful. The volume by Moore and Hedgecoe is at once the more substantial and the less expensive, so if you must make a choice based solely on price, you will not be the loser; however, both titles would be valuable acquisitions for most collections.

Surrounded by an odd assortment of friends and allies, the Hitman with a heart must deal with personal conflicts over honor and morals as he makes a living with a gun. But even with the telepathic ability to read his targets' minds, he still finds himself well over his head when he runs into some of Gotham's most notorious citizens such as the Demon, the Joker, and the Dark Knight himself, the Batman.<br><br>Plus, a vindictive mob boss from his past puts a contract out on Tommy. With his friends caught in the crossfire, he must find a way to take out the hired assassin and exact retribution against the mafia head. But even with his extrarodinary powers, the Hitman may find that a trained killer and a mob army is just too much for one man.</p><p>Tommy Monaghan is an assassin; that's right, he's your standard, grade-A hit man. Well, maybe he's not so standard. Tommy also happens to have super powers--just telepathy and x-ray vision, mind you. But let's face it, those are pretty super. Writer Garth Ennis and artist John McCrea have come up with a character that has surprising complexity. By all accounts this hit man should be an antihero, and yet, Monaghan has strict rules for himself: he doesn't shoot anyone he considers "one of the good guys." Naturally, there's a lot of subjectivity here, possibly even hypocrisy, but this murky area between good and evil, right and wrong, is one of Ennis's strong points. In what is essentially a superhero setting (Gotham City, home of Batman), this book delivers elements of action, adventure, crime, and horror, all held together by Ennis's funny and believable dialogue. The blurb on the back cover sums it up nicely: "No fancy costume. No magic tricks. Just plenty of ammo, a pack of cigs, and a pitcher of beer." <i>--Jim Pascoe</i>Garth Ennis is the award-winning writer of Hellblazer, Hitman, Punisher, Preacher, Pride and Joy and War Stories.

Or is he?<br><br>Nail-bitingly suspenseful, here is the deliciously eerie follow-up to <b>In the Forests of the Night</b>, by the remarkable fifteen-year-old novelist Amelia Atwater-Rhodes.</p><p>The teen queen of horror fiction Amelia Atwater-Rhodes is on the prowl again! Continuing in much the same vampire vein that established her reputation, the young writer's sophomore novel also includes a touch of autobiography. Jessica Allodola is a high school senior who pens vampire tales under the pseudonym Ash Night. (Hmmm, sound familiar?) Because of her funereal clothing and cynical demeanor, Jessica is shunned by her sunnier classmates. No matter, she prefers the company of the undead she creates on her laptop, anyway. But Jessica is shaken when a creature from her novel, the suave vampire Aubrey (who fans will remember from <i>In the Forests of the Night</i>) shows up as a new student at her school. Not knowing whether he plans to seduce or harm her, Jessica plays a dangerous game of cat and mouse with Aubrey as she tries to discover the secret of his existence. As she delves deeper into the midnight world of her own novels, she encounters other supernatural beings, like Fala, an evil Egyptian vampire, and Caryn Smoke, a teenaged good witch. When she finally unearths the shocking truth that explains the tangibility of her imaginary world, Jessica must decide if she loves that dark world enough to leave the light forever.<p> Atwater-Rhode's writing, while still showing strong traces of Anne Rice and Stephen King, is maturing nicely as she cleverly constructs this story within a story. Her vampires, while thousands of years old, have adolescent mood swings and tempers, which will sit well with the under-16 crowd. <i>Demon in My View</i> will undoubtedly find its way into many backpacks and Trapper Keepers.

In truth, the industry is listening. There is a church in Hollywood, but too often their work is unrecognized. Behind the Screen offers a glimpse of Hollywood insiders who, through their jobs on movie sets, behind TV shows, and in radio broadcasts, work together to give glory to God. With contributions from the writers and producers of such productions as Joan of Arcadia, Mission Impossible, Batman Forever, That &#39;70s Show, and others, believers everywhere are encouraged to join with the church in Hollywood and do their part in closing the gap between Christianity and culture.</p><p>Hollywood: Devil&#39;s playground or God&#39;s mission field? Joan of Arcadia, Mission Impossible, Batman Forever, and That &#39;70s Show have been some of the biggest productions in film and television. But did you know that Christians have been behind the scenes of these and other box office ratings smashes? Industry professionals Spencer Lewerenz and Barbara Nicolosi have discovered that the church is very much alive in Hollywood--and making a difference! Behind the Screen presents the fascinating look at Hollywood through the eyes of Christian writers, producers, and executives living out their faith behind TV shows, on movie sets, and in studio offices.

The principle deities are dealt with chiefly at the various periods in which they came into prominence, while the legends are so arranged as to throw light on the beliefs and manners and customs of the ancient people. Metrical renderings are given of such of the representative folk songs and poems as can be appreciated at the present day. Many of the earliest books, particularly those dating back to the 1900&#39;s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive. We are republishing these classic works in affordable, high quality, modern editions, using the original text and artwork.</p><p></p><h2>Clearing</h2><p>A sequence of poems in which Berry writes of the land he and his wife hold in trust--a farm they have tended for years and a new homestead they recently rescued from ecological disaster</p><p></p><h2>Cranberry Autumn</h2><p>A search of Grandmother&#39;s attic turns up a valuable item for Cranberryport&#39;s fall antique sale while, at the same time, the wily trickster, Cyrus Grape, threatens to spoil everything, bringing Mr. Whiskers and the rest of the town to the rescue.</p><p></p><h2>Guardian Angel: My Journey from Leftism to Sanity</h2><p><b>Once the darling of the Left, British journalist Melanie Phillips was &#x201c;mugged by reality&#x201d; to become a controversial champion of national and cultural identity.&nbsp;</b><br><br><i>Guardian Angel</i> is that rare memoir that grabs you by the shoulders with an urgency that screams, &#x201c;PAY ATTENTION!&#x201d; It leaps off the page with an immediacy and relevance that few books achieve.<br> <br>Beginning with her solitary childhood in London, it took years for Melanie Phillips to understand her parents&#x2019; emotional frailties and even longer to escape from them.

It was this moral foundation that ultimately turned her against the warped and tyrannical attitudes of the Left, requiring her to break away not only from her parents&#x2014;but also from the people she had seen as her wider political family.<br> <br>Through her poignant story of transformation and separation, we gain insight into the political uproar that has engulfed the West.

This cow was called Audhumla, and she lived all by herself on a frosty, misty plain, where there was nothing to be seen but heaps of snow and ice piled strangely over one another. Far away to the north it was night, far away to the south it was day; but all around where Audhumla lay a cold, grey twilight reigned.

In my office I have a number of author autographs lining the wall of my stairwell. Mark Twain. Harper Lee. Charles Dickens. Ernest Hemingway. Harriet Beecher Stowe. These writers are my mentors.

Yes, words have tremendous power. So much meaning can be packed into a word.<br> <br>In the book <i>Simple Little Words: What You Say Can Change a Life</i>, Dr. Dennis Hensley tells the story of how one perfect word changed a life.<br><br>In my capacity as a professor of English at Taylor University Fort Wayne, I teach a survey course in world literature that students of all majors are assigned to take as part of their liberal-arts requirements.<br> <br>A few years ago, I met Sean, a junior and wrestling-squad member who was majoring in elementary education. Sean had a shaved bullet head, legs like fire hydrants, a back that could put Atlas to shame, and biceps that looked like the drawing on boxes of Arm &amp; Hammer Baking Soda. This guy was tough.<br> <br>Sean enjoyed sports, and he excelled at weightlifting and track-and-field events such as discus and hammer throwing. However, he wasn&#x2019;t overly keen on literature. I knew quickly I&#x2019;d have my work cut out in making him an admirer of Keats, Shakespeare, Dante, and Melville.<br> <br>I modified Sean&#x2019;s reading list for that semester to include high-seas adventures by Jack London, mysteries by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and military works by Rudyard Kipling. We met in my office once each week to discuss the books and short stories, and I constantly praised Sean&#x2019;s ability to recognize symbolism, foreshadowing, flashbacks, and other elements of literary expressions that I had lectured about in class.<br> <br>As the semester advanced, so did Sean&#x2019;s grades. He had started as a C student, then rose to the B level. As I showed the class how the applications of literary analysis could help them better appreciate plays and movies, they all became more and more eager to get to class each day. Sean started sitting in the front row, taking copious notes, and I continued to compliment him on his diligence and studiousness.<br> <br>Then, one day, as I was grading papers, I was delighted to be able to give a perfect A to Sean on one of his quizzes over a new short story I&#x2019;d had the students read for that week. At the end of the quiz I wrote, &#x201c;This is superb work, son. I congratulate you. You&#x2019;ve been working hard, and this is the payoff. Well done!&#x201d;<br> <br>I passed the papers back, and I watched as Sean&#x2019;s face lit up in a grin when he saw the huge red A atop his quiz. However, when he turned the page over and read my personal note to him, his countenance changed entirely. He lowered his face, avoided eye contact with me the entire rest of the class, and left just as soon as the bell rang. I was thoroughly confused by such behavior until two days later.<br> <br>During office hours, I glanced up to Sean&#x2019;s hulking frame taking up my entire doorway. &#x201c;Can I come in for a moment, Dr. Hensley?&#x201d; he asked me. I motioned him toward a chair, and he closed the door behind him. I could see that he had his quiz in his hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir,&#x201d; he began, but then stopped. He lowered his head, and suddenly I realized that this giant of a man was actually weeping. I was stunned. I gave him a moment to collect himself. &#x201c;Sir, you don&#x2019;t know my background.&#x201d;<br> <br>I said nothing as Sean fished a handkerchief from his back pocket and wiped his eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;My dad left my mom and me when I was only seven,&#x201d; Sean said in a low voice. &#x201c;I somehow felt it was my fault that he left. I got it into my head that if I could just be a better son, my dad would come back and live with us again. We&#x2019;d all be happy then.&#x201d;<br> <br>He paused, then added, &#x201c;So, I played every sport at my schools and all the summer sports I could sign up for. I thought that if I could just hit enough home runs or score enough touchdowns or shoot enough baskets, my dad would be proud of me and would come back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did it work?&#x201d; I asked gently.<br> <br>Sean shook his head. &#x201c;My dad only showed up at three of my games during ten years that I was involved in sports. It was no big deal to him. I tried my best to impress him, but I always felt that I&#x2019;d failed. I haven&#x2019;t heard from my dad for the past two years, and I probably never will. I thought I had gotten past caring, until . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>I leaned forward a little.<br> <br>&#x201c;Until what, Sean?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Until I got my quiz back from you day before yesterday,&#x201d; he said, looking directly at me. &#x201c;You praised me . . . and you called me son. You might have meant it just as a passing catchphrase from an older man to a younger fellow, but it hit me like a freight train. I realized at that moment, that all my life I&#x2019;ve wanted to have a man whom I looked up to, to tell me he was proud of me and to call me son. You have no idea what this note on this paper means to me. I plan to keep this for the rest of my life.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sean wiped another sudden rush of tears from his eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;I came here to tell you something, Dr. Hensley. I want you to know that I&#x2019;m going to conduct my life from here on out&#x2014;in everything I do&#x2014;so that you will always be proud enough to call me son. I won&#x2019;t ever let you down. I promise you that. You&#x2019;ve given me something that I&#x2019;ve been yearning for my entire life, and I want to protect it.&#x201d;<br> <br>He rose, and so did I. I shook his hand and gave him a manly hug, concluding with a slap on the shoulder. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a fine man, Sean,&#x201d; I assured him. &#x201c;I have no doubt you&#x2019;ll make me proud of you in whatever you do in life.&#x201d;<br> <br>A year later, Sean graduated with his degree in elementary education. He passed the licensing examination for Indiana and took a job in one of the worst elementary schools in inner-city Indianapolis. Most of the students there were from single-parent families, and all were desperately poor. Sean became a surrogate father to many of them. He would take his old van into the projects and ghettos and pick up dozens of children and take them to sporting events, Saturday movies, or vacation Bible school. He called the boys &#x201c;son&#x201d; and the girls &#x201c;daughter,&#x201d; and they loved it.<br> <br>In calling Sean &#x201c;son,&#x201d; I not only changed his life, I gave him a focus on the ministry he wanted for his lifetime calling. He&#x2019;s now changing the lives of hundreds of other fatherless children.<br> <br>Yes, indeed, one word of encouragement can change the world.*<br><br> BREAKING IT DOWN<p></p> <br>That&#x2019;s power. One perfect word. Yet in this information age words swirl around us every day. Tens of thousands of words&#x2014; maybe a hundred thousand words on a crazy, busy day. We read newspapers, we check out blogs, we may follow Facebook and even Twitter. We respond to e-mail and we listen to real people talking ...and talking...and talking. We drive with the radio on. We try to squeeze in time to read books and magazines. We may turn on the television at night. Words come at us incessantly.<br> <br>But God says in Ecclesiastes 6:11, &#x201c;The more the words, the less the meaning, and how does that profit anyone?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hmmm. Maybe we need to go on a word diet. My children loved Dr. Seuss&#x2019;s books, especially <i>Green Eggs and Ham</i>. Did you know that book grew out of a challenge? After Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, had written several books, his editor Bennett Cerf challenged him to write a story using no more than fifty different words. <i>Green Eggs and Ham</i> was the result. What a delightfully madcap story to be penned out of a strict word budget.2<br> <br>So, what if, instead of tens of thousands of words every day, we meditated on just one book for a lifetime? That narrows it down. My NIV Bible weighs in at 727,969 words, according to the <i>New International Version Exhaustive Concordance</i>. Each year has a little more than 525,900 minutes in it. If we live to be eighty years old, that&#x2019;s about 42,000,000 minutes. If you subtract time for working, sleeping, and play, that still leaves a few million minutes. Meditating on one book is definitely doable in a lifetime, right?<br> <br>But what if we focused on only one passage? I started memorizing Scripture years ago when I first moved to Port Orchard, Washington. Those were some troubling times for me. I didn&#x2019;t recognize it at the time, but I was going through a deep spiritual battle. In retrospect I look back on that battle and see it as a major milestone in my spiritual life because it was then I started memorizing the Bible. One verse at a time, I made God&#x2019;s Word a living, breathing part of who I am. I can&#x2019;t even imagine who I&#x2019;d be today if I had not taken that step.<br> <br>In 1999, I memorized the third chapter of Ephesians. In my prayer journal toward the end of that year I wrote,<br><br><i>Help me to know You more and more. Plant Your words in my heart so that all I need do is recall a verse and instantly feel its power, instantly feel the immeasurable sense of Your love engulf me. This year has been an incredible experience. Each day as I recite the passage I&#x2019;m touched again by the sheer wonder and depth of emotion I feel in Paul&#x2019;s prayer.</i><br><br>I closed my written prayer with a request: &#x201c;May my own words touch lives for You.&#x201d; That one book, the Bible, has changed my life.<br> <br>But forget whole passages for now. Let&#x2019;s break it down even further. What if I had one word&#x2014;just one word&#x2014;to meditate on for a whole day? How rich would that day be? Being a word person, I can&#x2019;t think of anything quite as fun as to luxuriate in one single word for the whole day, turning it around and looking at it from every angle.<br> <br>And it doesn&#x2019;t have to be a complicated word. In his book <i>Orthodoxy</i>, G. K. Chesterton says, &#x201c;Long words go rattling by us like long railway trains. We know they are carrying thousands who are too tired or too indolent to walk and think for themselves. It is good exercise to try for once in a way to express any opinion one holds in words of one syllable.&#x201d;3<br> <br>God continues to tell us, &#x201c;Be still . . .&#x201d; In this barrage of wordiness, what does stillness look like? Maybe it means we take it one step farther and explore just one word for a whole year.<br> ONE PERFECT WORD<p></p> <br>For almost twenty years I&#x2019;ve been meeting with a group of women entrepreneurs for breakfast once a week. Many years back, my breakfast-club ladies and I decided to do just that: every January we&#x2019;ve each selected a word to serve as a personal focus for the year. Over time the words I&#x2019;ve chosen have had a powerful impact on my life.<br> <br>But the title of this book is <i>One Perfect Word</i>. <i>Perfect</i>. Talk about pressure. If I was the one doing the word choice for each year I&#x2019;d never be so bold as to call that choice <i>perfect</i>. The surprising thing is that when we decide we want to focus on one word for the year, God takes part in the choosing. That&#x2019;s why the word is perfect for us. We may not see it at the time, but as we look back we see that it all worked together&#x2014;our word, our life, our journey.<br> <br>When I find my word and begin to explore it, God takes me deep into that one word. Because I&#x2019;ve kept journals nearly my entire life, I have been able to look back at them in the light of my word of the year and see how my life experiences dovetailed with my exploration of that year&#x2019;s word. Preparing to write this book has been an eye-opening journey.<br> <br>In John 15:7, the Lord says, &#x201c;If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.&#x201d; That could be the story of my life. As I&#x2019;ve tried to remain in Him and tuck His words deep in my soul, I&#x2019;ve asked, I&#x2019;ve imagined, and I&#x2019;ve dreamed. The second part of that verse says, &#x201c;Ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.&#x201d; I have to confess, God&#x2019;s blessed me far beyond that for which I have asked. Why should that be such a big surprise? That verse carries a promise. And God always keeps His promises.<br> <br>When we choose one single word from His Word and spend a year with it, I&#x2019;ve found that the Lord takes us by the hand and walks us through the year, teaching us about that word, about ourselves, and even more, about God Himself.<br> <br>There are two things I hope to accomplish in the pages of this book. First, I want to encourage you to begin the practice of focusing on one perfect word each year. We&#x2019;ll talk about how to find the word, how to explore it, and how to recognize the life lessons that grow out of that exploration.<br> <br>Second, I&#x2019;ve chosen fourteen of my own words of the year to share with you. By telling stories that illustrate each particular word&#x2014;some from my life and some from others&#x2019; lives&#x2014;and showing some of what I&#x2019;ve learned about the word, I&#x2019;m hoping you&#x2019;ll see God&#x2019;s fingerprints all over the exercise.<br> <br>Sometimes my entries in my prayer journal over the years&#x2014;my written prayers&#x2014;express my one perfect word in the moment of discovery. In that case, you&#x2019;ll see the prayer set alongside the text.<br> <br>Once in a while, I&#x2019;ll have a practical tip as to how to make a word come alive in a different medium. Some of us are more visual or tactile. I will share hints I&#x2019;ve gleaned on making the word of the year tangible. You&#x2019;ll find those tips labeled &#x201c;Wordplay&#x201d; and set apart in a box.<br> CHOOSING THE WORD<p></p> <br>In preparing for the start of a new year, I always go over my goals for the previous year, doing an intensive postmortem, so to speak. Which goals did I reach? Which did I exceed? Which do I need to rethink or restrategize? I usually read over my journals to get an overview of the year past. Often my word becomes clear during this time of introspection.<br> <br>Sometimes, though, I don&#x2019;t get the word until a couple of weeks into the new year.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m not one for New Year&#x2019;s resolutions because they usually don&#x2019;t lend themselves to developing the strategy needed to carry them out. I am a goal-oriented person. I set goals and then go about devising ways to reach my yearly objectives.<br> <br>Your word for the year is different from goals and resolutions. You don&#x2019;t necessarily choose a goal word like, say, <i>advancement</i>. The word is likely to be a complex concept that you will use throughout the year to explore a new aspect of your relationship with God and others. It needs to be something you will be happy to chew on for fifty-two weeks.<br> LISTENING FOR THE WORD<p></p> <br>My friend, fellow writer, and plotting partner Rachel Hauck also chooses a word each year.

The boy proved resistant to smallpox, and Jenner's risky experiment produced the earliest vaccination. In this deftly written account, journalist Arthur Allen reveals a history of vaccination that is both illuminated with hope and shrouded by controversy&#x2014;from Jenner's discovery to Pasteur's vaccines for rabies and cholera, to those that safeguarded the children of the twentieth century, and finally to the tumult currently surrounding vaccination.<br><br>Faced with threats from anthrax to AIDS, we are a vulnerable population and can no longer depend on vaccines; numerous studies have linked childhood vaccination with various neurological disorders, and our pharmaceutical companies are more attracted to the profits of treatment than to the prevention of disease. With narrative grace and investigative journalism, Allen explores our shifting understanding of vaccination since its creation. 16 pages of illustrations.</p><p><b>Arthur Allen</b> is a Washington-based journalist who has written on aspects of this subject in the <i>New York Times Magazine, The New Republic, the Washington Post, The Atlantic</i>, and <i>Salon</i>.Reviewed by Laurie Garrett<p> When I was six days old, I nearly died of chicken pox. This was explained to me almost casually by my mother six years later as she commanded me to sleep over at a friend's home, where another child was suffering from the rubella form of measles. It was just possible, Mother said, that I got chicken pox because she had been exposed to the disease during the final days of her pregnancy but had no immunity to the virus -- and thus failed to pass on protective antibodies to poor little me. To make sure that I would not one day give birth to a rubella-damaged baby or miscarry, Mother sent me to that dreaded sleep-over. I did indeed become infected. And for several miserable days, I lay in quarantine, delirious, dehydrated and bored, covered in red blotches and angry as heck that Mother had put me through the ordeal.</p><p> Such stories used to be commonplace. In Vaccine, Arthur Allen tells us that by the early 1960s, rubella was a leading cause of some types of birth defects and miscarriages in America, as well as the motivation for thousands of therapeutic abortions aimed at avoiding giving birth to babies damaged by the virus. By the decade's close, however, pediatricians were able to vaccinate youngsters against polio, rubella, diphtheria, measles and tetanus with shots and droplets. The vaccine inventors were hailed as heroes and international celebrities.</p><p> But within a generation, such diseases were all but forgotten in wealthy nations, and parents began weighing the risks of the diseases against the possible side effects of the vaccines. Today, we have come full circle, with many of the vaccine pioneers now vilified and their products blamed for everything from AIDS to autism. For all too many American parents, the risk equation has changed, leading them to oppose immunization with one or more of the key pediatric vaccines. Allen, a former Associated Press reporter who writes a column on risks for Slate, began thinking hard about these issues after facing decisions regarding the vaccination of his own two children. </p><p>Vaccine is two books, really. The first is a historical account of experiments with vaccination from the early 18th century, when Cotton Mather tried to inoculate his neighbors in colonial Boston against smallpox, through the peak of vaccine development in the 1960s. Written in a straightforward fashion, this book offers few surprises to students of vaccine history, but it does deliver a very accessible account of American (and, to a lesser degree, European) scientific discoveries, public health campaigns and their controversies. The take-home message: Though vaccines have clearly saved lives and stopped epidemics, the practice of immunization has always been controversial, with organized skeptics claiming that vaccines would anger God, kill children, cause innumerable diseases, worsen epidemics and produce defective offspring.</p><p>Then, in what feels like a separate book, Allen offers his own analysis of the current state of anti-vaccine sentiments in the United States. This section alone is well worth the price of admission. With genuine panache, Allen describes the "legislative jihad against vaccines" led by Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.), as well as the mind-boggling array of political and religious forces that have, over the last decade, claimed child vaccination to be responsible for everything from brain disorders and autism to causing the very diseases the products are designed to prevent.</p><p> The modern skeptics' primary target is a mercury-based vaccine stabilizer called thimerosal, which critics charge has caused a sharp increase in autism in America. Between 1992 and 2002, the skeptics note, doctors in the United States diagnosed 10 times more cases of the syndrome. But anti-vaccine critics fail to note that between 1987 and 2004, the American Psychiatric Association's official Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders revised its definition of autism twice; each time that resulted in an immediate surge in the number of children identified as autistic. Further, when the definitions of autism were standardized, it turned out that Denmark (where no thimerosal was used in vaccines) and Minnesota had the same per capita incidence of autism. Finally, studies show that boys are at least four times more likely than girls to suffer from functional autism, but boys and girls are equally likely to be vaccinated. </p><p>Because Allen does not often reflect on the ways that contemporary battles may mirror those described in his earlier historical treatise, the two halves of his book are not well-linked. For example, he offers a concise analysis of the early days of the development of a vaccine for polio, when the pioneering Hilary Koprowski tried out an innovative oral vaccine on thousands of youngsters in Congo. In passing, Allen notes that during the 1990s, a British journalist named Edward Hooper falsely claimed that Koprowski's experiments spawned the AIDS pandemic. But Allen misses the next chapter in that sorry saga: Having read Hooper's claims, a cluster of imams in northern Nigeria announced that Muslims should refuse to have their children vaccinated against polio. Overnight, the global fight against polio shifted; the disease, which had been on the brink of complete eradication, again spread throughout the Muslim world and parts of India. </p><p>Similarly, Allen misses the impact that doubts about mercury contamination of vaccines had in some far-flung parts of the former Soviet Union. By the time Mikhail Gorbachev took over control of the Kremlin, less than a third of families in Moscow, Kiev, St. Petersburg and Siberia were allowing doctors to fully vaccinate their children. In the 1980s, Soviet soldiers returning from combat in Afghanistan brought diphtheria back to the largely unvaccinated population, with devastating results. By the early 1990s, Russia and Ukraine combined had a diphtheria epidemic involving a quarter of a million people. </p><p> Twenty years ago, the Science magazine reporter Jon Cohen -- arguably the greatest observer of contemporary vaccine research -- set out to write a book about the discovery of an AIDS vaccine. He was optimistic that scientists would soon find the key to stopping the dreaded virus. Today, more than 30 million people are living with HIV, the pandemic continues to spread, and vaccine manufacturers openly express skepticism that a product to stop this hideous disease will ever pass American safety standards. As Allen's book tells us, we have come a long, depressing way from the glory days of vaccine heroism. </p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

She lives in Denver, Colorado. Recently she sat down with Maggie Stiefvater to discuss Stiefvater's <em>Ballad</em> and <em>The Wolves of Mercy Falls</em> series. Read the resulting interview below, or turn the tables to see what happened when Maggie interviewed Brenna. </p> <p> <strong>Brenna:</strong> Even though we all know that characters are not authors, we also know that characters sort of are their authors (at least a little bit). Which of your characters would you say is most like you as a person? </p> <p> <strong>Maggie:</strong> Well, most of my characters are delightfully single-minded, because that is what characters do. So if I were arguing a high-level thesis paper, I&#x2019;d probably declare that, in fact, all of my characters are really me, just exaggerated, stripped of gray areas and less than crystal clear motivations. Even the evil ones. Maybe especially the evil ones. &gt;br/&gt; <br> That said, I&#x2019;ve been told I&#x2019;m quite like Isabel from the <i>Shiver</i> [<i>Wolves of Mercy Falls</i>] series and James from <i>Ballad</i>. </p> <p> <strong>Brenna:</strong> If Cole from the <i>Shiver</i> trilogy and James from <i>Ballad</i> had to fight each other in a snark-off, who would win?</p> <p> <strong>Maggie:</strong> James, I&#x2019;m afraid. Cole has learned to rely far too much on his appearance to win these things and sometimes, my friends, a finely crafted chin will just not get you ahead in life. </p> <p> <strong>Brenna:</strong> When your characters are romantically involved, they&#x2019;re willing to fight desperately to be together, often against seemingly insurmountable odds. Like when their significant others turn into wolves and run away into the forest. Where do you stand on the topic of true love? </p> <p> <strong>Maggie:</strong> I&#x2019;m a fan/ believer/ proponent of true love. I think it&#x2019;s worth waiting for, and I also think it&#x2019;s worth fighting for once you&#x2019;ve found it. I&#x2019;m one of those madly in love people who just doesn&#x2019;t understand why anyone would stand for anything less. I also find long-term dating confusing. I was engaged after a month and a half because, like Grace in <i>Shiver</i>, I am bad at shopping. I just see what I want, and then I go and get it. </p> <p></p> <p> <strong>Brenna:</strong> Cole St. Clair&#x2019;s band Narkotika is, understandably, not a real band. However, if it were a real band, what would it sound like? </p> <p> <strong>Maggie:</strong> Well, I think that Narkotika, like love, is in the eye of the beholder. It&#x2019;s supposed to be an edgy, hard, slightly unsettling band, and that varies depending on what you listen to. Also, it was originally an electronica band (think Blaqk Audio). These days I go through life thinking that possibly they would sound like Ringside. Or Korn. Or Carolina Liar. Or Three Days Grace. I realize that these bands sound nothing like each other. I have no good explanation for that. </p> <p> <strong>Brenna:</strong> What would you say to all the woefully optimistic girls out there (i.e., me) who want to know if Cole would date them?

If by &#x201c;date,&#x201d; you mean &#x201c;make out with you in a dark hallway, remove some of your clothing, completely avoid giving you his contact information, disappear, and make you have a resulting existential crisis about why you date boys who treat you badly.&#x201d; <br> <br> The please wouldn&#x2019;t be necessary. </p><p>After a tumultuous past as a history major, calligraphy instructor, wedding musician, technical editor, and equestrian artist, <strong>Maggie Stiefvater</strong> is now a full-time writer and <em>New York Times&nbsp;</em>bestselling author of<em>&nbsp;</em>the Shiver trilogy<em>,&nbsp;The Scorpio Races,</em> and <em>The Raven Boys. </em>Her debut series, the Books of Faerie, is published by Flux.

Whenever there is new evidence or a new analysis about Jesus, the newspapers get interested. Many continued to be fascinated by the person of Jesus and by whether or not he actually did and said what the New Testament Gospels say he did.<br><br>This new book, written in a lively, non-technical style by biblical theologian Tom Wright, is an ideal introduction for anyone approaching the subject of the "historical Jesus" for the first time.<br><br>In <i>The Original Jesus</i> Wright focuses on key stages in Jesus' life and on key elements of his teaching. In the process, Wright presents a vivid reconstruction of what Jesus himself was aiming to achieve and how the movement he began can best be understood in relation to the turbulent politics and fervent aspirations of his day. Wright also looks at the way we interpret the different Gospel narratives about Jesus, showing how modern readers coming fresh to these texts can do so in an informed and discriminating way.<br><br>Based on rigorous historical research and featuring numerous full-color illustrations as well as short, clear chapters, <i>The Original Jesus</i> offers compelling insight into what Jesus really stood for, why he was crucified, and how it was that his followers came to regard him as nothing less than the human face of God.</p><p>N.

Popaditch is immortalized forever as "The Cigar Marine."<br><br>April 6, 2004: The tanker fights heroically in the battle for Fallujah and suffers grievous head wounds that leave him legally blind and partially deaf. The USMC awards him with a Silver Star for his valor and combat innovation.<br><br>April 18, 2004: "Gunny Pop" comes home to face the toughest fight of his life-a battle to remain the man and Marine he was. This is the central drama of Nick's inspiring memoir, Once a Marine: An Iraq War Tank Commander's Inspirational Memoir of Combat, Courage, and Recovery.<br><br>Readers in and out of the military will stand up and cheer for this valiant Marine's Marine, a man who embodies everything noble and proud in the Corps' long tradition. Never has modern mechanized combat seemed so immediate and real, or the fight in Iraq seemed so human and worth believing in.<br><br>At first, Nick fights to get back to where he was in Iraq-in the cupola of an M1A1 main battle tank, leading Marines in combat at the point of the spear. As the seriousness and permanence of his disabilities become more evident, Nick fights to remain in the Corps in any capacity, to help the brothers in arms he so aches to rejoin. Facing the inevitable following a medical retirement, he battles for rightful recognition and compensation for his permanent disabilities. Throughout his harrowing ordeal, Nick fights to maintain his honor and loyalty, waging all these battles the same way-the Marine way-because anything less would be a betrayal of all he holds dear.<br><br>The real triumph in Once a Marine is its previously untold, behind-the-scenes tale of the day-to-day life of a career Marine noncommissioned staff officer. In most books and movies, a "Gunny" is little more than a cardboard character. Nick's portrayal is a man complete: a husband and father, as well as a warrior and a molder of young warriors. He reveals himself completely, something no memoirist in his position has ever done before. This includes our very personal introduction to his wife April, whose heroics in the story equal Nick's, together with dozens of others who, as Sgt. Popaditch writes, gave so much, so selflessly and freely, to him. Like the man himself, Once a Marine is full of gratitude and refreshingly free of false bravado and braggadocio.<br><br>All Americans, of all political persuasions, have a duty to meet this courageous and admirable fighting man, an exemplar of all our military men and women who give so much out of love for their nation. Meeting Gunny Sergeant Popaditch through the pages of his inspirational memoir offers up new reasons to be proud and shoulder our own responsibilities as Americans.<br><br>Once a Marine will instantly take its place among outstanding combat classics. And once you read this remarkable and uplifting book, The Marine's Hymn will never sound the same.</p><p>From East Chicago, Indiana, Nick Popaditch enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1986. He was wounded while commanding a tank in Fallujah (Iraq) in 2004 and medically retired from the Marines in 2005 at the rank of Gunnery Sergeant. &#x201c;Gunny&#x201d; and his wife April have two children, Richard and Nicholas. They reside in Chula Vista, California.<br><br>"Only a few books leap off the shelves and demand to be read- and "Once a Marine" is one of those few...a spellbinding story...the type of book that the reader will devour in an evening". (<i>Midwest Book Review</i>)<br><br>"For a rough &amp; tough Marine Gunnery Sergeant, Popaditch has written a brutally honest, yet incredibly moving story of his life as a Marine, and how the Marine Corps has prepared him for life afterwards.

Who formed the household and what were the ties of kinship, law, and affection that bound the members together? David Herlihy explores these questions from ancient Greece to the households of fifteenth-century Tuscany, to provide a broad new interpretation of family life. In a series of bold hypotheses, he presents his ideas about the emergence of a distinctive medieval household and its transformation over a thousand years.</p><p>Ancient societies lacked the concept of the family as a moral unit and displayed an extraordinary variety of living arrangements, from the huge palaces of the rich to the hovels of the slaves. Not until the seventh and eighth centuries did families take on a more standard form as a result of the congruence of material circumstances, ideological pressures, and the force of cultural norms. By the eleventh century, families had acquired a characteristic kinship organization first visible among elites and then spreading to other classes. From an indifferent network of descent through either male or female lines evolved the new concept of patrilineage, or descent and inheritance through the male line. For the first time a clear set of emotional ties linked family members.</p><p>It is the author&#x2019;s singular contribution to show how, as they evolved from their heritages of either barbarian society or classical antiquity, medieval households developed commensurable forms, distinctive ties of kindred, and a tighter moral and emotional unity to produce the family as we know it. Herlihy&#x2019;s range of sources is prodigious: ancient Roman and Greek authors, Aquinas, Augustine, archives of monasteries, sermons of saints, civil and canon law, inquisitorial records, civil registers, charters, censuses and surveys, wills, marriage certificates, birth records, and more. This well-written book will be the starting point for all future studies of medieval domestic life.</p></p><p>David Herlihy (d. 1991) was Barnaby Conrad and Mary Critchfield Keeney Professor and Professor of History at Brown University.&#x201c;Immensely stimulating...[this book] contains a vast amount of original scholarship. Herlihy has a rare talent for incorporating lively narrative evidence into the context suggested by quantifiable data and writing about it with grace and verve... This book will provide the analytical framework against which all subsequent regional studies will be tested.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Nicholas</b><b>, </b><b><i>American Historical Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Herlihy&#x2019;s work will undoubtedly form a centerpoint for subsequent debate on the development of the medieval household. There is much to ponder here... Provocative...unearthing a rich vein of narrative and other material, it commands the attention of all historians interested in the early European family.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Continuity and Change</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Here is a happy marriage: a preeminent historian tackling the thorniest of problems, household and family in medieval Europe. The result is altogether felicitous, a rich, detailed, well-written, and fascinating book of extraordinary range, one designed for students and general readers that will also be invaluable to specialists.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert S. Gottfried</b><b>, </b><b><i>Speculum: A Journal of Medieval Studies</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Herlihy&#x2019;s excellent work makes accessible persuasive counterarguments against the theory that affection for children developed only recently. Herlihy...demonstrates how modern society moved toward its definition of &#x2018;family&#x2019; and shows its emergence in the medieval period. He uses scattered and diverse source material to trace the development of the family from Roman times to the medieval development of common expectations of family life applicable to all classes. The sources, ranging from well-known classical and medieval writers such as Aristotle, Tacitus, Aquinas, and Augustine to monastic archives, sermons, lives of saints, and civil archives, provide models and reflections of family life, including the church&#x2019;s use of scripture to establish marital and family standards applicable to ruler and serf alike... Herlihy helps overcome the negative stereotype of the medieval family by showing how present-day standards for family life emerged in that earlier time. This book will become the standard source for family history in cultural context. In spite of its erudition, it is accessible to undergraduates... [A] fascinating, readable, and scholarly work.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Written in a clear and vigorous prose, Herlihy&#x2019;s history of the European family and his compelling explanation for the emergence of our very concept of the family should become starting points for any further discussions of this much discussed topic.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Anthony Molho, Brown University</b></p><h2>How to Make $1,000,000 in the Stock Market Automatically: (4th Edition)</h2><p>Explains the Automatic Investment Management technique for making money in the stock market, discussing timing, stocks, inflation, money funds, and retirement.</p><p><b>Robert Lichello</b>, an award-winning author and broadcaster, has been a newspaper reporter and editor where his financial columns have appeared in numerous national magazines.

With happy spirits, the veterans set out for home, clogging rail depots, bus stations and airports creating, at that time, the greatest traffic jam in the nation&#39;s history. Some of the more fortunate are driven thousands of miles home by grateful citizens demonstrating the Christmas spirit in their own unique way.Across the nation, people crowd churches praying with gratitude for the peace in place, and reach out to wounded veterans, children who lost fathers,and neighbors who lost sons.

Now, it&#39;s your turn!<b>WHO ARE YOU, REALLY?<br><i>Discover your true potential and become the person you truly want to be</i></b><br><br>Imagine you woke up one day in a land populated almost entirely by giants. At first you would no doubt be terrified, and the deafening roar of loud noises and the uncomfortable sinking feeling when you fell would stick with you for a lifetime. After a time, you would realize that many of the giants seemed friendly, and that one giant in particular was taking a special interest in your safety and well-being.<br><br>Then imagine that one day, for no reason whatsoever, the giant you had learned to trust completely yelled at you, threatened you, even hit you. How could you ever feel safe again in a land of giants? There must be some laws of the land or rules that you could learn to help you survive.<br><br>One day, you meet some other little people. They appear to be like you, and in their company, you instantly feel more secure. Some of them claim to know the laws of the land, and share them with you. Combined with the insight you've gained from observing the giants and listening to them teach you in their booming, godlike voices, you begin to figure out what you need to do and not do to stay safe.<br><br>Do as you are told. It's easier to get along if you go along. Don't cry. Don't fight. Study hard. Get a job. Do as you are told. Get married. Have children to support you in your old age. Do as you are told.<br><br>The list grows longer as your once tiny body grows larger (nurtured no doubt by the special food produced in the land of the giants), and eventually you come to realize that there are no giants left.<br><br>And then one day you wake up, and there is a tiny little creature staring up at you. She has awakened in a land of giants. And because you love her, you begin to teach her everything you've learned about how to survive in this land of giants.<br><br>And so the cycle continues. . . .<br><br><i>THE POWER OF BRAINWASHING</i><br><br>During the Korean civil war of the late 1950s, the Chinese Koreans successfully converted an unprecedented number of American POWs to the "religion" of communism. They didn't do it through threat of torture or even promise of reward&#x2014;they did it by simply changing the soldier's self-image.<br><br>What the Chinese understood was that our behavior is a direct result of the person we <i>believe</i> we are&#x2014;our self-image. Think of it like a loop&#x2014;we are constantly confirming to ourselves that we are the person we think we are, but the system we use to interpret our behavior and feedback is our own self-image. It's a catch-22.<br><br>So the Chinese interrupted the loop. You might think it was a big task reprogramming men who had been highly trained only to give their name, rank, and serial number, but the Chinese did it bit by bit.<br><br>During an interrogation, prisoners were persuaded to make one or two mildly anti-American or pro-communist statements. (For example, "The United States is not perfect," or "In a communist country, there is less unemployment and crime.") Once these apparently minor statements had been extracted, the prisoner would then be asked to define exactly how the United States was not perfect. When he was worn down and weary, he would then be asked to sign his name to the list of reasons he had come up with.<br><br>Later, the prisoner would be made to read his list in a discussion group with other prisoners. The Chinese would then broadcast his name and list of reasons during an anti-American radio broadcast not only to his own camp but to all the other North Korean POW camps and the rest of the American forces in South Korea as well.<br><br>Suddenly, the prisoner found himself labeled a collaborator, someone who participated in the kind of behavior that helped the enemy. When fellow prisoners asked why he had done it, he couldn't claim he had been tortured. After all, he had said those things and signed his name to them.<br><br>Psychological research has shown that human beings can tolerate only a certain amount of discrepancy between their thoughts and their behavior. Like anyone unaware of the power of his own self-image, the prisoner felt he had to justify his actions in order to maintain consistency with his own internal sense of identity. He would say that what he had said was true. In that moment his self-image changed. He now believed that he was pro-communist, and his fellow prisoners reinforced his new identity by treating him differently. The loop was complete.<br><br>Before long, his desire to act consistently with his new self-image would drive him to collaborate with the Chinese even more, thereby further reinforcing his new self-image until he no longer even questioned it was true.<br><br><i>WHAT IS A SELF-IMAGE?</i><br><br>Your self-image is the way you see yourself in your imagination. The reason your self-image is so powerful is because your behavior will almost never deviate from this internal map. It acts as a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy, telling you how to behave or perform to act consistently with the kind of person you think you are. Yet many people don't even realize they have an image of themselves until they look.<br><br>We've all met people who are attractive but who think of themselves as ugly&#x2014;too fat or too thin or too old or too young. If you truly believe you are unattractive, you will unconsciously sabotage any attempts to make yourself appear attractive. Because you won't represent yourself at your best, people will inevitably find you unattractive, and the prophecy is fulfilled.<br><br>Studies have shown that an extraordinary number of people who suddenly receive large sums of money through lottery wins or inheritance are likely to lose it again almost as quickly. Even people who earn their money are likely to lose it if what they are earning is more than they believe they are worth. They feel uncomfortable with the extra money, so they spend it, lend it, or find some other way to get rid of it.<br><br>Celebrities whose star rises too high too fast can also be brought back to earth by the gravitational pull of a limited self-image. In fact, so many celebrities suffer from self-destructive behavior brought on by feelings of unworthiness that psychologists have created a name for the pattern: the paradise syndrome.<br><br>How you think of yourself also affects how other people feel about you. Because more than 90 percent of what you communicate is unconscious, the people around you are continually responding to your body language, tone of voice, and the emotional signals you are transmitting. Even if the words you use sound positive, you may well find yourself conveying one message verbally and a completely different message with your body language.<br><br>Here's the point:<br><br><i>You are constantly letting other people know how to treat you by the way you treat yourself.</i><br><br>In the book <i>The Mastery of Love</i>, Don Miguel Ruiz shares the analogy of living in a restaurant where food was plentiful. If someone came to the door and offered you a pizza but you'd have to let them abuse you for the rest of your life, you'd laugh in his face. But if you were living in the street and hadn't eaten for days and that same person made you that same offer, you'd be likely to consider it. We settle for what we feel we are worth&#x2014;that is, we will never allow anyone to abuse us more than we abuse ourselves.<br><br><i>SUCCESS AND THE SELF-IMAGE</i><br><br>Unfortunately, while each failure reinforces the self-fulfilling prophecy of your negative self-image, your outer successes rarely change it for the better. No matter how much you have on the outside&#x2014;big house, big car, money&#x2014;it will not ultimately satisfy you if you don't already feel good about yourself on the inside.<br><br>Over the years I have had the opportunity to meet and work with a large number of successful people. I am continually struck by how many of them create an outer veneer as a way of hiding personal feelings of inadequacy. For example, they project any number of things to compensate for a lack of inner self-worth, flouting their wealth, status, intellectual achievement, physical strength, social connections, or moral "superiority" in an attempt to prove that they are not as worthless as they feel inside.<br><br>Sometimes it starts out with a little lie or a small affectation, but over the years it develops into an entire outer persona that is the complete opposite of how they feel on the inside. They continually feel like a fraud, fearing that at any moment they are going to be "found out" and it will all be taken away from them. In fact, many people whom we consider in our culture to have everything are secret self-haters. I call this the "bling-bling factor"&#x2014;the bigger the jewelry, the smaller the self-image.<br><br>However, the bling-bling factor is by no means exclusively a problem of the rich and famous. In fact, having worked with people from all walks of life, I have come to the conclusion that almost<i> everybody</i> is to some extent hiding or compensating for a part of themselves that they don't like.<br><br>For a long time I felt that if only I could be rich enough or famous enough, or date lots of beautiful women, then I would feel better about myself. I had been a nerdy kid, and my solution to that was to affix a veneer of success to myself so that no one (including myself) would notice how inadequate I really felt.<br><br>Over a relatively short period of time, I worked incredibly hard at achieving and did very well. I became famous, made money, and created all the trappings of a glamorous life. My TV shows were a huge hit; I had more money than ever before and a beautiful model girlfriend. Rock stars, movie stars, even royalty wanted me to work with them.<br><br>However, I kept thinking, "I have everything I have ever wanted&#x2014;how come I still feel empty?"<br><br><i>SO HOW IS YOUR SELF-IMAGE FORMED?</i><br><br>While s...</p><h2>Paul&#39;s Idea of Community: The Early House Churches in Their Cultural Setting</h2><p>Robert Bank's widely read <i>Paul's Idea of Community: The Early House Churches in their Cultural Setting</i> is once again available to laypeole, pastors and scholars alike.

Scott Bartchy, University of California, Los Angeles -- <i>Review</i></p><h2>Privileged to Kill</h2><p>After giving the stranger with the flat tire a ride into town, Undersheriff Bill Gastner decides that Wesley Crocker is a good man, but after a child&#39;s body is found, he must prove to the sheriff that his instincts are correct</p><p>More trouble has winged into New Mexico's Posadas County, this time on the heels of rolling stone Wesley Crocker, whom Undersheriff Bill Gastner gives a lift into town when he meets him on the road wheeling his crippled bicycle. But a flat tire is the least of Crocker's problems. After bedding down for the night under the stars on the school athletic field, he's in the lockup by morning for questioning about the death of shoplifting teenager Maria Elena Ibarra, whose body was dumped less than a hundred yards from his bedroll--all, he mildly insists, without disturbing him. And even though the autopsy reveals that Maria had accidentally choked to death on a slice of pizza, Crocker's troubles--and Bill's--are far from over. Maria's shiftless uncle knocks back a snootful of sherry fortified with enough extra alcohol to send him to sleep for good; a grisly road accident will leave another student dead; and Crocker will be turned loose in time to get into more trouble himself. What's behind this rash of untimely deaths, and what does it all have to do with the harmless drifter? Underneath the low-key, high-casualty plot, Havill's fifth (Before She Dies, p. 176, etc.) quietly continues a project virtually unique in detective fiction: anchoring his tales of crime and punishment as closely as possible in the rhythms of small-town friends, routines, and calamities. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Bill Gastner can't sleep, eats way too much Mexican food and seems headed for a stroke. But in his fifth adventure (after Before She Dies), the aging undersheriff of Posadas County, N.M., labors 'round the clock to solve the mysterious death of a 15-year-old girl. Maria Ibarra's body was found under the high-school football field bleachers. The first suspect is Wesley Crocker, an itinerant bicyclist whom Gastner, out of kindness, had treated to a meal the previous night. Gastner feels certain that Crocker is innocent, a notion confirmed when an unknown motorist tries to run down the cyclist. Vanessa Davila, a friend of Maria's, flees when police question her. Then a bright, popular student is killed in a suspicious car accident. Like Gastner, readers may feel stymied until the last evidence turns up, but there is a cleverly planted clue in the early pages. A strong sense of place and tough but compassionate characters distinguish this series. Gastner and his valued friend, deputy Estelle Reyes-Guzman, pull the case together, while Estelle and her doctor husband urge the undersheriff to start caring for himself. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gardening with Woodland Plants</h2><p>Woodland plants add magic to any garden, with lush carpets of color, foliage at the middle level, and majestic height.

James VI of Scotland -- now James I of England -- came into his new kingdom in 1603. Trained almost from birth to manage rival political factions, he was determined not only to hold his throne, but to avoid the strife caused by religious groups that was bedevilling most European countries. He would hold his God-appointed position and unify his kingdom. Out of these circumstances, and involving the very people who were engaged in the bitterest controversies, a book of extraordinary grace and lasting literary appeal was created: the King James Bible. 47 scholars from Cambridge, Oxford and London translated the Bible, drawing from many previous versions, and created what many believe to be the greatest prose work ever written in English -- the product of a culture in a peculiarly conflicted era. This was the England of Shakespeare, Marlowe, Jonson and Bacon; but also of extremist Puritans, the Gunpowder plot, the Plague, of slum dwellings and crushing religious confines. Quite how this astonishing translation emerges is the central question of this book. Far more than Shakespeare, this Bible helped to create and shape the language. It is the origin of many of our most familiar phrases, and the foundations of the English-speaking world. It was a generous and deliberate decision to make the Bible available to the common man: not an immediate commercial success, but which later became a bestseller, and has remained one ever since. Adam Nicolson gives a fascinating and dramatic account of the early years of the first Stewart ruler, and the scholars who laboured for seven years to create the world&#39;s greatest book; immersing us in a world of ingratiating bishops, a fascinating monarch and London at a time unlike any other.</p><p>Adam Nicolson is the author of many books on history, travel and the environment. He is winner of the Somerset Maugham Award and the British Topography Prize and lives on a farm in Sussex.&#39;This scrupulously elegant account of the creation of what four centuries of history has confirmed is the finest English-language work of all time, is entirely true to its subject: Adam Nicolson&#39;s lapidary prose is masterly, his measured account both as readable as the curious demand and as dignified as the story deserves.&#39; Simon Winchester &#39;Vivid, exhilarating, consistently intelligent, you can almost taste the air breathed by these Jacobean heroes, who gave English its most famous book.

London is already friends with Corto and introduces the sailor to the unpredictable Russian, who even as a young man kills with disconcerting ease and is ready to lie and betray without hesitation. It is, however, "the beginning of a beautiful friendship" that continues throughout the series. As a bonus, the book includes additional material that sets up the entire series, as well as several never-before published pages that Pratt intended for a continuation of the tale, in which Corto and Rasputin were to embark on a search for King Solomon's mines.</p><p><b>Hugo Pratt</b> (1927-1995) is considered one of the great graphic novelists in the history of the medium.

Around them, giraffes stretched their necks to reach the leaves at the top of the highest acacia trees. Cheetahs raced across the grass, chasing the elephants in game after game of tag.<br> &nbsp;<br> Shimmering snow fell gently on Mt. Shiveer, covering the ski tracks the penguins and pandas left on the slopes. In a cozy hut near the top of the mountain, snow leopards and arctic wolves toasted their friendship with steaming mugs of hot cocoa.<br> &nbsp;<br> The normally quiet Sarepia Forest was alive with music as bunnies thumped their feet in rhythm while lions provided a bass line. Raccoons danced and twirled in the clearing, and soon even the wolves gave in and joined the frolicking.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Kimbara Outback, kangaroos cooled off in the clear streams running out from the great reservoir, laughing and splashing one another. Nearby, some koalas napped while others leisurely munched away at an all-you-can-eat eucalyptus-leaf buffet.<br> &nbsp;<br> Horses galloped up the rocky trails of Coral Canyons to join the foxes and lions around a crackling campfire. The sun began to set, causing the mesa surrounding them to glow red and orange. A few eagles soaring overhead dipped lower to listen as the foxes told tale after tale.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although they celebrated in different ways, the animals were all rejoicing for the same reason. They enjoyed a deep connection to their land and strong friendships with one another. And to strengthen this, each species had just received an incredible gift from the guardian spirits of Jamaa: a Heartstone.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your Heartstone contains the essence of your species,&#x201d; Mira had told them, spreading her great heron wings and ruffling her blue-gray feathers. Her eyes shone with pride, and her long beak curved in a gentle smile. &#x201c;It contains what makes you special&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the secret of what makes you who you are.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re beautiful,&#x201d; said a panda, his eyes wide with awe.<br> &nbsp;<br> A raccoon nodded in agreement. &#x201c;But what if we lose them?&#x201d; she fretted. &#x201c;How can we keep them safe?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Zios answered, his expression radiating warmth. &#x201c;Mira and I have a place in mind to store all the Heartstones together.&#x201d; The guardian spirit looked down at the animals through his golden mask.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All together?&#x201d; asked a wolf, arching his brow.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mira nodded. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be safe there. We promise.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The animals agreed, and so the two guardian spirits of Jamaa hid the Heartstones beneath the Lost Temple of Zios, an ancient temple that had stood in the jungle for as long as anyone could remember. And for many years afterward, animals across the land continued to live in peace and harmony.<br> &nbsp;<br> But as time went on, seeds of suspicion began to bloom in their hearts. The cheetahs became convinced the tigers envied their speed. The nervous raccoons told themselves the wolves looked rather shifty. The foxes&#x2019; tall tales began to irritate the lions, who were starting to think foxes lied a little too naturally. Soon, not a single species trusted another.<br> &nbsp;<br> The wolves were the first to remove their Heartstone from beneath the Lost Temple of Zios. The others soon followed their example, bringing their Heartstones to their individual villages, and the camaraderie between the animals of Jamaa was lost.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was during this time of division that a new threat began to creep its slimy tentacles into Jamaa: a horde of evil Phantoms. They were led by the cruel Phantom Queen, and no one in Jamaa had ever seen such vile creatures. The Phantoms spread filth and pollution all over the land, and as they did, rumors about their intentions began to spread as well.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re poisoning the water,&#x201d; one monkey informed another over a murky watering hole. &#x201c;To make us sick.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re polluting the air,&#x201d; a kangaroo croaked after a long coughing fit. &#x201c;To make us leave.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not just ruining our environment,&#x201d; a tiger realized somberly. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re making it hospitable for themselves. They want to take over Jamaa.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Before long, the Phantoms set their sights on the Heartstones. Not only did they take over the animals&#x2019; villages and steal the precious jewels, the Phantoms turned their power to a darker purpose: using each Heartstone to trap its entire species.<br> &nbsp;<br> One by one, the animals vanished: the kangaroos, the lions, the raccoons, the elephants, the cheetahs. And with every disappearance, all the other species withdrew even more, trusting no one but themselves.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although Mira and Zios were powerful guardians, even they could not stop the Phantoms&#x2019; progress. And before they knew it, there were only six Heartstones&#x2014;and six species&#x2014;left in Jamaa.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><b> Chapter 1<br></b> <br>&nbsp;<br> Mira soared through the sky, surveying the land she loved in dismay. Most of Jamaa was polluted almost beyond recognition. The crisp, fresh air of Sarepia Forest was now heavy with gray smog that caused the giant green trees to shrivel and turn brown. The clear waters of Crystal Reef were murky and muddy, and the majestic glaciers of Mt. Shiveer had begun to melt.<br> &nbsp;<br> Worst of all, the sounds of life that once filled every corner of the land were all but gone. Mira&#x2019;s heart ached as she remembered the splashing dolphins in Kani Cove, the galloping horses of Coral Canyons, and the peaceful sloths that used to inhabit the lush jungle surrounding the Lost Temple of Zios. There had been so many wonderfully different species, all sharing Jamaa and living in harmony.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to believe this is the same land,&#x201d; Mira said when Zios appeared at her side. &#x201c;How can we possibly reverse all the destruction the Phantoms have caused?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think we can,&#x201d; Zios replied, his voice deep with sadness. &#x201c;At least, not while the Phantoms continue spreading their pollution&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and stealing Heartstones. I fear they will soon be the only creatures left.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mira sighed, contemplating the barren land below them. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t allow that to happen,&#x201d; she said determinedly. &#x201c;There are still animals in Jamaa. This is their rightful land.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It is,&#x201d; Zios agreed. &#x201c;But you know they&#x2019;re in hiding. Their only concern is protecting the Heartstones.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mira arched her slender neck, the sunlight making her feathers sparkle. &#x201c;I know the Phantoms are powerful. But, Zios, we accomplished so many incredible things when the species all lived and worked together, remember?&#x201d; She sighed wistfully. &#x201c;There was no challenge that couldn&#x2019;t be met. If the remaining animals could unite once more, the way they used to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Zios knew what Mira was thinking. &#x201c;They just might be able to take Jamaa back from the Phantoms,&#x201d; he finished. He closed his eyes and concentrated, then turned to his companion. &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re right, Mira. It&#x2019;s our best chance&#x2014;and theirs. We must try.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And so the two guardian spirits of Jamaa called the remaining six species of animals together: pandas, monkeys, koalas, bunnies, tigers, and wolves. Volunteers from each species gathered at the Lost Temple of Zios, pawing the ground, peering out from the bushes, hanging from branches, eyes darting around suspiciously. The animals were eager to reclaim their land, but their mistrust of one another was obvious. Especially when it came to their Heartstones.<br> &nbsp;<br> Zios solemnly moved from one group to the next, collecting the Heartstones. Although the species were reluctant to part with the precious stones, one by one they handed them over to the guardian spirit Zios. Only once he had stored them in a safe place did the animals turn their attention to Mira.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Animals of Jamaa,&#x201d; the heron called, her voice ringing around the clearing. &#x201c;We know you have your differences. But it is time to set those aside, for you have a common foe.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A few of the animals murmured in agreement. Others looked more doubtful, but listened intently.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The Phantoms have poisoned our land,&#x201d; Zios rumbled. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not too late. It is possible for us to defeat this enemy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by working together.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A high-pitched, hissing laugh caused all the animals to startle and look around. A Phantom appeared from behind a wilting silk-cotton tree and glided through the clearing. He had four spindly tentacles on each side like a spider, and the pupil of his eye was extra tiny and beady. Several of the animals growled and glared, but the Phantom responded with an evil sneer that caused even the wolves to fall silent.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My name is Leach,&#x201d; he said, his voice slithering in and out of their ears like a snake. &#x201c;And this is Stench.&#x201d; A second Phantom appeared behind the bunnies, sniggering when they jumped in fright. Stench had two large, lumbering tentacles that seemed too big for his body, and several smaller tentacles that waved uselessly on top of his head. He tried to glare at the animals as menacingly as Leach, but one tiny tentacle fell limp in front of his eye. Stench batted it away with a bigger tentacle and accidentally poked himself in the pupil.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ow,&#x201d; he mumbled. A few bunnies tittered, and Leach&#x2019;s eye narrowed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We have a message from the Phantom Queen,&#x201d; Leach announced, his voice soft but menacing. The giggling stopped abruptly. &#x201c;She knows what you are planning, and she knows you will not succeed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Stench continued, &#x201c;You believe we Phantoms are the problem. But the truth is, Jamaa&#x2019;s problems began before our arrival. They began&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mira and Zios exchanged a worried look. But before they could respond, a koala piped up.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s talking about the wolves!&#x201d; he cried accusingly. &#x201c;We all know the wolves are responsible for letting the Phantoms into this land to begin with.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A tiger tossed his head. &#x201c;That may be so, but you koalas and your laziness helped the Phantoms take over, despite the valiant effort of my species to defend our land.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You tigers are so arrogant. You don&#x2019;t know what the rest of us have done to try to protect Jamaa,&#x201d; a monkey called out from where she dangled from a particularly high branch. &#x201c;Although at least you&#x2019;re willing to fight. Unlike the bunnies, who just turn their fuzzy little tails and run.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The bunnies hopped up and down and shook their fists angrily. The tigers pawed the ground. The wolves huddled closer together, hackles raised and teeth bared. Mira and Zios looked on helplessly.<br> &nbsp;<br> Leach cackled and hissed. &#x201c;Quite an army you&#x2019;ve put together, oh great guardian spirits of Jamaa,&#x201d; he told them, his eye flashing darkly. &#x201c;Now, let&#x2019;s see how they fight.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Suddenly, the leaves rustled and the bushes shook. The bickering animals fell silent as a blue-white electric glow began to grow all around them.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Attack!&#x201d; Stench bellowed, flapping his lumbering tentacles and nearly knocking Leach over. Dozens of Phantoms emerged from the shadows and swarmed into the clearing. Chaos erupted.<br> &nbsp;<br> Overhead, the monkeys frantically began to build a net from leaves and vines. &#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; one yelped as a koala snatched the vine from his hands.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We should use these as lassos!&#x201d; the koala cried. &#x201c;That would be much more useful than a net!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Their argument was drowned out by the mighty roars of the tigers, who charged headfirst into battle without looking to see what the other species were doing. The wolves prowled around on the outskirts, watching and waiting.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Join us, you cowards!&#x201d; one tiger called. &#x201c;Or do you not know which side you&#x2019;re fighting for?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s foolish to engage with an enemy you know little about,&#x201d; a wolf replied with a sneer. &#x201c;But go ahead with your blind attack so we can learn what doesn&#x2019;t work.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A few pandas surrounded one of the Phantoms. &#x201c;Maybe we can talk about this,&#x201d; one began, paws raised in a peaceful gesture. But with lightning-fast speed, several bunnies hopped into attack mode, waving sticks and leaping between the pandas and the Phantom.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Phantoms saw the divisiveness between all the species and used it to their advantage. Their tentacles twirled rapidly, and they hacked at the vines until they fell, tangling the koalas and monkeys in their own lassos and nets. They allowed the tigers to chase them over to the wolves, and then levitated into the air, watching as the two species clashed with each other. They burned the leaves of the silk-cotton tree until the bunnies couldn&#x2019;t see through the smoke, causing them to surround the pandas instead.<br> &nbsp;<br> In all the confusion, no one noticed Leach slipping into the entrance of one of the stone buildings. He soon emerged carrying a gleaming jewel. The sparkle caught Mira&#x2019;s eye, and she gasped.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He has a Heartstone!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her otherworldly cry seemed to almost shimmer in the air, rising like a song above the sounds of battle. Snarling, a wolf leaped toward Leach just as a monkey swung down and snatched the Heartstone. Leach shifted nimbly out of the way, and the wolf tumbled to the ground with the monkey in his paws.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Get off, wolf!&#x201d; the monkey cried, dropping the Heartstone and leaping back up into the trees. Suddenly, a blinding light emanated from the center of the turmoil. Shielding his eye, Leach slipped back into the jungle, followed by Stench and the rest of the Phantoms. Confused and frightened, the other animals fled in different directions.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the sounds of the stampede had faded, the bright light dimmed and disappeared to reveal Zios standing guard over the Heartstone lying in the grass. He examined it as Mira joined him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The tigers,&#x201d; he said gravely. &#x201c;This is their Heartstone. The battle was just a distraction. Leach must have intended on stealing it while the others were fighting.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mira&#x2019;s feathers rustled in the breeze. &#x201c;Fighting against one another instead of against the Phantoms,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;Leach was right. The problems in Jamaa began before the Phantoms arrived, when the species stopped trusting one another. And they still don&#x2019;t trust each other. If we&#x2019;re ever going to restore this land, they must regain that trust. But how will we ever do that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They need to see proof,&#x201d; Zios replied thoughtfully. &#x201c;Proof that they can put their faith in each other. Proof that they&#x2019;re stronger when they&#x2019;re united. Th�ey need leaders.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mira continued Zios&#x2019;s train of thought. &#x201c;Six leaders, one representing each species, all working together and combining their powers. And then, if they can convince the other animals to join them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ,&#x201d; she said, a smile forming.<br> &nbsp;<br> Zios&#x2019;s eyes glimmered. &#x201c;Then surely they can drive the Phantoms out once and for all!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mira stretched her wings gracefully. &#x201c;What are we waiting for? Let&#x2019;s find the leaders who will save Jamaa!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Circle Pizzazz: 12 Vibrant Quilt Projects � Easy Curves&#x2015;Endless Possibilities</h2><p>If you liked the way Judy Sisneros&#x2019; best-selling 9-Patch Pizzazz and Rectangle Pizzazz turned simple shapes into knockout quilts, you&#x2019;ll love the magic Judy works with pieced circles.

This book presents that dramatic story with Mary Pope Osborne&#x2019;s brief text and with stunning frescoes created by Bonnie Christensen, using the same colors, style, and technique as the ancient frescoes unearthed at Pompeii. In addition to the destruction of Pompeii and the rediscovery of the ruins nearly 1,700 years later, the book shows what daily life was like in this prosperous Roman town in the year 79 A.D.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p><b>Mary Pope Osborne</b>&nbsp;is the author of the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;number one bestselling Magic Tree House series as well as co-author of the Magic Tree House Fact Tracker series, along with her husband, Will, and her sister, Natalie Pope Boyce.&nbsp;For more information, visit the Magic Tree House� website at MagicTreeHouse.com!&nbsp;<br><br><b>Bonnie Christensen</b> was an author and illustrator of books for young readers.

She died in 2015.Starred Review. Grade 3-5&#x2013;After brief accounts of the events of 79 A.D. and the first archaeological investigations of the city that lay beneath the fields surrounding Mt. Vesuvius, Osborne's straightforward text focuses on the life at Pompeii at the time of the volcano's eruption. Discussions of daily activities include mention of the many types of buildings unearthed, such as private homes, bakeries, baths, and markets, as well as the activities enjoyed by the free citizens of Pompeii&#x2013;concerts, plays, and gladiator fights. A large illustration, flanked on the right by two boxes containing text and a smaller picture, occupies most of each spread. Christensen's distinctive, haunting frescoes are reminiscent of the art found throughout the site. Some illustrations are copies of original artwork, while others offer glimpses into what the city may have looked like prior to the volcano's eruption, detail objects found on location, and offer readers information on dress, decoration, and architecture. The illustrations are framed with decorative patterns typical of the period and the colors used reflect those found at Pompeii, including the distinctive, earthen red of some of its most familiar frescoes. While Osborne's text does not go into great detail, it will serve as an enticing introduction to this legendary city frozen in time. Students ready for more information will be fascinated by James M.

Blending postbellum electricity with an off-beat Catholic pedigree, the Walkers take turns imparting the family history, bringing a whole new meaning to the term Southern Gothic. Siddalee, the eldest daughter, is at the centre of the narrative and with her customary flair and drama she recounts the family&#39;s more outlandish exploits, often involving her mother, Vivi, one of the legendary &#39;Ya-Ya&#39;s&#39; whose reckless drinking, repressed rage and exuberance for life and love left an indelible mark on the young Walker&#39;s childhoods. Little Altars Everywhere is often outrageous and wildly funny and yet beneath each comic turn lies the dark reality of life on Pecan Grove Plantation.</p><p>"It can wear you to a nub, trying to be a popular person and a good Catholic all at the same time." So says Sidda, one of the characters inhabiting <i>Little Altars Everywhere</i>. Author Rebecca Wells uses her considerable acting talent to perform this abridgment, adding even more spark to her already lively characters. Everyone--Shep, Vivi, Willetta, and the rest--is given a distinct voice, and Wells plays each of them to the hilt.

He summoned Berdichevsky and Sister Pelagia and read out the report to them, although he occasionally frowned at the insufferably rollicking freedom of the style.&nbsp;<br><br> Alexei Stepanovich&#x2019; s First Letter&nbsp;<br><br> To Roland&#x2019;s most glorious Archbishop Turpin from his faithful paladin, sent to do battle with enchanters and Saracens,&nbsp;<br><br> Oh pastor of great wisdom and sternness,&nbsp;<br> Terror of deep-rooted superstitions,&nbsp;<br> Luminary of faith and loving-kindness,&nbsp;<br> Defender of orphans and lash of the proud!&nbsp;<br> At your feet do I humbly cast down&nbsp;<br> My simple and artless tale.&nbsp;<br> Ah-oo!&nbsp;<br><br> As, shaking on a creaking wagon,&nbsp;<br> I struggled through the kingdom of Zavolzhsk,&nbsp;<br> And on that mournful road did count&nbsp;<br> Fifteen thousand, one hundred and one&nbsp;<br> Ruts and also potholes deep,&nbsp;<br> Many a time there came to me&nbsp;<br> Bad thoughts about Your Grace&#x2019;s person&nbsp;<br> And I did utter sacrilegious words.&nbsp;<br> Ah-oo!&nbsp;<br><br> But when the Blue Sea&#x2019;s sacred waters&nbsp;<br> Did glitter brightly in the distance far,&nbsp;<br> Conquered by this captivating landscape,&nbsp;<br> Straightaway did I forget my hardships,&nbsp;<br> And prayed as I was borne across&nbsp;<br> On the smoke-puffing, snow white vessel&nbsp;<br> Named for the good Saint Basilisk.&nbsp;<br> Ah-oo!&nbsp;<br><br> Through the long, moonlit, chilly night&nbsp;<br> I shivered &#x2019;neath my meager blanket&nbsp;<br> And when I tried to close my eyes in sleep,&nbsp;<br> My fragile dreams were forthwith interrupted&nbsp;<br> By the captain&#x2019;s wild swearing rant,&nbsp;<br> The devout chanting of the sailors&#x2019; prayers,&nbsp;<br> And the bell&#x2019;s booming hourly chime.&nbsp;<br><br> And so, to switch from exhausting versification to delightfully welcome prose, I disembarked on the quayside in New Ararat short of sleep and as bad-tempered as the devil. Oh, forgive me, Father&#x2014;it just slipped out, and if I cross it out now, it will look untidy, and you don&#x2019;t like that, so to hell with the devil, let&nbsp; him be.&nbsp;<br><br> To tell the truth, in addition to the sounds of the ship, I was also prevented from sleeping by the book that you placed in my basket, together with the incomparable episcopal curd rolls, as you saw me off, adding in a most innocent voice, &#x201c;Pay no attention to the title, Alyosha, and don&#x2019;t worry, it&#x2019;s not religious reading, just a little novel&#x2014;to help you pass the time on the journey.&#x201d; Oh most perfidious of the priests of Babylon!&nbsp;<br><br> The title&#x2014;<i>The Possessed</i>&#x2014;and the substantial thickness of the &#x201c;little novel&#x201d; really did frighten me at first, and I only started reading it on the steamer, to the sound of the waves splashing and the seagulls calling. In one night I read it halfway through, and I think I have understood why you slipped me this inarticulate but inspired treatise masquerading as belles lettres. Not, of course, because of that senseless rogue Petrusha Verkhovensky and those caricatured Carbonari who are his comrades, but for the sake of Stavrogin, in whose example you no doubt perceive my own fatal danger: to play the&nbsp;<i>�bermensch</i>&nbsp;and end up as a buffoon or, in your terminology, &#x201c;to doom my immortal soul.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> A shot wide of the mark, Eminence. There is a fundamental difference between the Byronic Mr. Stavrogin and me. He acts outrageously because he believes in god (I can just see how you have wrinkled up your brow at this point&#x2014;very well then, let it&nbsp; be &#x201c;in God&#x201d;) and he feels offended with Him: Why will You not turn Your paternal gaze on a naughty child like me, why do You not rebuke me or crush me under Your foot? Hey there! Where are You? Wake up! Or else I might start imagining You don&#x2019;t even exist. Stavrogin is bored with the company of ordinary people; what he wants is the supreme Interlocutor. But, unlike Dostoyevsky&#x2019;s defiler of little girls and seducer of idiots, I do not believe either in God or god, and that is my firm position. Human company is quite sufficient for me.&nbsp;<br><br> Your earlier literary hint was closer to the mark, when you made me a present of Count Tolstoy&#x2019;s composition&nbsp;<i>War and Peace</i>&nbsp;for my saint&#x2019;s day. I am more like Bolkonsky&#x2014;not, of course, in terms of his lordliness, but in sharing an interest in Bonapartism. I am twenty-four now, and there is still no sign of my Toulon; in fact there is not even a distant prospect of it. Tolstoy&#x2019;s prince developed such exorbitant vanity owing to his full belly and blas� attitude, for, after all, Fortune had simply given him every imaginable sweet morsel in her possession&#x2014;noble status, wealth, beauty&#x2014;all by right of birth, so that he had nothing else left to wish for except to become the people&#x2019;s idol. But I, by contrast, come from the estate of the half-starved and envious, which, by the way, makes me much more like Napoleon than Tolstoy&#x2019;s aristocrat is and improves my chances of an emperor&#x2019;s crown. But, joking aside, it is more difficult for a man with a full belly to scramble up to the height of a Bonaparte than for a hungry man, because a full belly inclines a man not to nimble climbing, but to philosophizing and peaceful dreaming.&nbsp;<br><br> But I have gotten carried away. What you expect from me is not lofty verbiage about literature, but a spy&#x2019;s report about your patrimonial estate that has been engulfed in turmoil and discord.&nbsp;<br><br> Let me hasten to reassure Your Reverence. As is usually the case, the seat of the trouble appears far more frightening from a distance than from close up. Sitting in Zavolzhsk, one might imagine that in New Ararat everyone talks of nothing but the Black Monk and the normal flow of life has been totally mesmerized.&nbsp;<br><br> Nothing of the sort. Life here pulsates and gurgles in livelier fashion than in your provincial capital, and so far I have not heard any gossip at all about your Saint Dracula, that is,&nbsp;<i>entschuldigen</i>, Saint Basilisk.&nbsp;<br><br> At first I found New Ararat disappointing, since on the morning of my arrival the lake was covered by low clouds, which were pouring a repulsive cold rain down onto the islands, and the landscape I saw from the deck of the steamship was all wet mouse color: slimy gray bell towers with a terrible resemblance to enema tubes and the dejected roofs of the small town.&nbsp;<br><br> Mindful of the fact that all my expenses will be paid out of your abundant treasure houses, I ordered the porter to take me&nbsp; to the very best local hotel, which bears the proud name of Noah&#x2019;s Ark. I had been expecting to see some kind of gloomy log structure dimly lit with icon lamps, but I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel is fitted out in a perfectly European fashion: the room has a bathroom, mirrors, and molding on the ceiling.&nbsp;<br><br> The majority of the guests consists of gentlewomen already of a platonic age from St. Petersburg and Moscow, but in the evening, in the coffee shop on the ground floor, I saw a veritable Princess Lointaine such as is not to be found in quiet Zavolzhsk. I do not know if the like has ever happened before in the global history of relations between the sexes, but I fell in love with the beautiful stranger on the spot, from behind, even before she turned around. Picture to yourself, my pious pastor, a slim figure in an exquisite dress of black silk and a wide-brimmed hat with ostrich feathers, and delicate, supple neck, quite blinding in its perfection, looking like a tapering alabaster column.&nbsp;<br><br> Sensing my gaze, the Princess turned to present me with her profile, which I could not make out clearly, since her majesty&#x2019;s face was half-covered with a hazy veil, but what I did see was enough: a slim nose with the very slightest of aquiline curves, eyes with a moist glint . . . You are familiar with that female peculiarity (ah, but yes, how could you be, with your celibate status!) of surveying an extremely broad sector of the immediate vicinity with the edge of their vision without actually turning around very far. A man would have to twist around his entire neck and his shoulders, but a charming creature such as this one merely turns her eye a little to the side and sees everything she needs in an instant.&nbsp;<br><br> I am sure that the Princess made out all the details of my modest (oh, very well&#x2014;let it be immodest) person. And, note, she did not turn away immediately, but first gently touched her throat and only then turned the regal back of her head to me once again. Oh, how much that gesture means, that spontaneous raising of the fingers to the source of the breath!&nbsp;</p><h2>GIANTS IN THEIR TALL BLACK HATS: Essays on the Iron Brigade (Great Lakes Connections: The Civil War)</h2><p><p>Editors Alan Nolan and Sharon Eggleston Vipond's insightful essays provide fresh perspectives on the Iron Brigade's exploits, detailing military and political events in the words of actual combatants." &#x2015;Military Review</p><p>Originally called "The Black Hat Brigade" because the soldiers wore the regular army&#x2019;s dress black hat instead of the more typical blue cap, the Iron Brigade was the only all-Western brigade in the Eastern armies of the Union.

Jones's prizewinning collection, Lost in the City, lies far from the city of historic monuments and national politicians. Jones takes the reader beyond that world into the lives of African American men and women who work against the constant threat of loss to maintain a sense of hope. From "The Girl Who Raised Pigeons" to the well-to-do career woman awakened in the night by a phone call that will take her on a journey back to the past, the characters in these stories forge bonds of community as they struggle against the limits of their city to stave off the loss of family, friends, memories, and, ultimately, themselves. </p> <p> Critically acclaimed upon publication, <i>Lost in the City</i> heralds Jones as a new talent, a writer whose unaffected style is not only evocative and forceful but also filled with insight and poignancy. </p></p><p><p> Edward P. Jones was born and raised in Washington, D.C. Winner of the Pen/Hemingway Award and recipient of the Lannan Foundation Grant, Jones was educated at Holy Cross College and the University of Virginia. His first book, <i>Lost in the City</i> was originally published by William Morrow in 1992 and shortlisted for the National Book Award. Mr. Jones was named a National Book Award finalist for a second time with the publication of his debut novel <i>The Known World</i> which subsequently won the prestigious 2004 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. </p>At once folksy and urbane, this debut collection of stories pulses with the lifeblood of the forgotten neighborhoods of Washington, D.C., where Jones's black people are less the victims of society than of fate and chance. What unites the multihued African-Americans here is their sense of loss, whether it's of a family member taken in casual violence, or of one's soul, lost to drugs or ambition. A parentless teenager in ``The Night Rhonda Ferguson Was Killed,'' a girl full of confidence and spunk, finds her world shattered by her best friend's senseless death. Similarly, a middle-class man, leading ``a civilized life'' in the city, is devastated when his 15-year- old daughter runs away from home, never to return (``A New Man''). A motherless girl fills the void in her life with pigeons, until they too die or abandon the dying neighborhood (``The Girl Who Raised Pigeons''). Jones's unsparing view encompasses the hustler of ``Young Lions,'' a petty crook who enlists his loving girlfriend in a cruel scam; the middle-aged mother in ``His Mother's House,'' who ignores the source of her drug-dealing son's beneficence; and the high-powered lawyer in the title piece, who anesthetizes herself from her past with cocaine and passionless sex. But there's struggle, uplift, and survival in adversity here as well. In ``The Store,'' an unambitious young man grumbles through menial jobs, until he ends up attending Georgetown, in spite of himself. A dignified divorced woman keeps her family together in ``An Orange Line Train to Ballston.'' And a grown-up brother and sister cope differently with their father, who has spent most of their lives in jail for murdering their mother (``The Sunday Following Mother's Day''). Jones unerringly captures the quiet stateliness of elderly women in a trio of stories, culminating in ``Marie,'' which is his most self-reflexive piece. A skillful, elegiac collection, with remarkably little sociology. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

She knew who was calling.<br><br>"He's asking for you," the nurse said. "I think you'd better hurry."<br><br>"I'll be right there."<br><br>She ran through the living room, past the darkened Christmas tree and up the stairs to the second floor of the town house. Although she tried to be quiet, the bedroom door squeaked as she opened it, and Ray lifted his head from the pillow. He was never an easy sleeper.<br><br>"The hospital called," she said, slipping off her robe and pulling a pair of jeans from her dresser drawer. "I have to go."<br><br>Ray sat up and switched on his bedside light. "Is he...?" He didn't finish the sentence as he reached for his glasses on the night table. He looked dazed, blinking against the intrusion of light in the room.<br><br>"He's still alive," she said. "But I think this is it." She heard the lack of emotion in her voice as the calm and collected scientist in her took over.<br><br>"I'll come with you," Ray said, throwing off the covers. "I'll get Emma up and she and I can wait in&#x2014;"<br><br>"No." She pulled her sweater over her head, then leaned over to kiss him. "You and Emma stay here. No sense waking her up. Besides, I need to get there quickly."<br><br>"All right." Ray smoothed his hands over his thinning brown hair. "But call if you change your mind and want us to come."<br><br>He looked like an oversized little boy, sitting on the edge of the bed in his striped pajamas, and Laura felt a quick surge of love for him. "I will," she said, giving him a hug. "Thanks."<br><br>Outside, the air was still and cold. She drove quickly through the neighborhood, the houses and trees ablaze with colored lights. On the main road through Leesburg, she hit red light after red light, and even though the streets were nearly empty, she stopped dutifully at each of them.<br><br>Her father had wanted no heroic measures, and he'd received none. Although Laura agreed philosophically with his decision, her emotions were another matter, and these past few days she'd been hoping for a miracle. She wasn't ready to lose him. Carl Brandon had been the one consistent person in her life, always there for her. Her relationship with him had not been perfect, but who had a perfect relationship with their father? He'd turned eighty a few months ago, right after the cancer came back. She'd given him a party after hours in the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum, turning on the planetarium lights for him. It would be his last party, and she knew there was nothing he would love better than to gaze at the sea of stars above him. He'd nearly ignored the guests in favor of the mechanically created sky.<br><br>Only a few cars were parked in the visitors' lot, and she found a spot close to the hospital entrance. Inside, the lobby was eerily empty and dimly lit. Shivering as she walked through it, she tried to prepare herself for what lay ahead. She would find her father at peace. He was not afraid of dying, and that comforted her. He had an astronomer's appreciation of his own irrelevance. When your passion was the sky and the stars and the planets, the insignificance of your life was a given.<br><br>So, she would hold his hand as he drifted away from her. She would be very strong. Then she would drive home and Ray would comfort her. In the morning, she would tell Emma that Poppa had died. She had already tried to explain to her five-year-old daughter about Poppa's illness, trying to equate what was happening to him to what had happened to Emma's guinea pig the year before. But Emma, despite asking dozens of questions, seemed unable to grasp the concept of <em>forever. </em>And Laura, who had always scoffed at the notion of heaven, found herself using the idea to comfort Emma. And at times, herself.<br><br>She knew the instant she entered her father's room that he was not at peace. He was clearly worse than when she'd seen him that afternoon. His breathing was raspier, his skin grayer, and he was agitated. As he reached for her, his long arms trembling in the air, he wore a look of desperation on his once-handsome face.<br><br>She took his hand and sat on the edge of his bed.<br><br>"I'm here, Dad." She guessed he had not wanted to die without her at his side and wished she'd ignored those red lights to get to the hospital sooner.<br><br>He held both her hands in his weak grasp, but even with her there, the desperate look did not leave his eyes. He tried to speak, the words coming out between his gasps for air. "Should... have...told..." he said.<br><br>She leaned close to hear him. From that angle, she could see the stars of Aries through the hospital window. "Don't try to speak, Dad." She smoothed a tuft of white hair away from his temple.<br><br>"A woman," he said. "You need..." Her father's face, gaunt and gray, tightened with frustration as he struggled to get the words out.<br><br>"I need to what, Dad?" she asked gently.<br><br>"Look..." His lips trembled from the strain of speaking. "Look after her," he said.<br><br>Laura drew away to study his face. Could he be delusional? "Okay," she said. "I will. Please don't try to talk anymore."<br><br>He let go of her hand to reach toward the night table, his arm jerking with the motion. Laura saw the scrap of paper he was aiming for and picked it up herself. Her father had written a name on the paper in a nearly illegible scrawl that threatened to break her heart.<br><br>"Sarah Tolley," Laura read. "Who is that?"<br><br>"Friend," he said. "Important...has no...family." He swallowed with effort, his Adam's apple a sharp blade beneath the skin of his throat. "Promise."<br><br>He wanted her to look after a woman named Sarah Tolley?<br><br>"But...who is she?" Laura asked. <em>"Where </em>is she?"<br><br>His eyes were closed. "Meadow...Wood..."<br><br>"Meadow Wood Village?" Laura pictured the attractive, Victorian-style retirement home on the outskirts of Leesburg.<br><br>He nodded. At least she thought he did.<br><br>"Can you tell me what you want me to do for her?" she asked.<br><br>"Take care..."<br><br>"Take care of her?" Laura asked. "But I don't know her, Dad. I've never even heard you talk about her before."<br><br>Her father's paper-thin eyelids fluttered open, and she saw panic in his eyes. "Promise!" he said. In a nearly spasmodic movement, he reached toward her as if trying to grasp her shoulders, but he caught his fingers in the chain of her necklace instead. She felt the chain snap, and the pendant fell into her lap.<br><br>Unsettled by his panic, she caught his hands. "It's all right, Daddy," she said. "I promise. I'll take care of her."<br><br>"Swear..."<br><br>"I'll do it, Dad." She leaned back to slip the scrap of paper into her jeans pocket. "You don't need to worry."<br><br>He sank back against the pillow, pointing one trembling finger toward her neck. "I broke..."<br><br>"It's all right." She lifted the necklace from her lap and slipped it, too, into her jeans pocket. "It can be fixed." She took his hand again and held it on her thigh. "You rest now," she said.<br><br>Obediently, he closed his eyes, their small battle over. Small battles were nothing new between them. Her mother had died when Laura was seven, and her father had been a difficult parent, demanding and controlling, but always attentive. She had been his top priority, and she knew it. He'd instilled in her his love of astronomy, although for him it had been a cherished avocation rather than a profession, and he was responsible for the person she'd become. His methodical shaping of her had at times been painful and contentious, but she was grateful for it.<br><br>She sat there for hours, holding her father's hand as it grew slacker and cooler in her own. Taped to the wall was a picture Emma had drawn for him a few days earlier. It was one of those typical five-year-old's drawings. Vivid blue sky. Yellow sun. Green tree. A child dressed in blue and purple, wearing a broad smile, the sort of smile Emma herself wore more often than not. Laura studied the drawing, saddened by the incongruity of that happy child with the scene in this room.<br><br>She looked out the window again. Aries was gone, but she could see Jupiter near the center of Aquarius. She closed her eyes, and it was a minute before she realized that her father's breathing had stopped. Sitting very still, she held his lifeless hand in hers, as the room filled with a silence as deep as the sky.<br><br>The eastern skywas purplewiththe approaching dawn when she arrived home from the hospital. Ray was brewing coffee, wearing his blue terry-cloth robe, a splash of color in the white, uncluttered kitchen. He walked toward her once she was in the door, his arms outstretched, and she could tell he hadn't slept well. Dark circles marred the skin beneath his eyes, and the stubble of his beard was white. For a moment, she felt the fear of losing him, too. He was sixty-one, twenty-one years older than she, and these last few years had taken a toll on him. When she buried her head against his shoulder, she wasn't sure if her tears were for her father or her husband.<br><br>"He died about an hour ago," she said, drawing away from him. She wiped her eyes with a tissue, then took the mug of coffee he handed her and sat down at the table.<br><br>"I'm glad you got to be there with him," he said.<br><br>"It was upsetting." She held the mug between her cold hands. "I thought I'd just sit with him while he... slipped away. But he was very anxious. Really wired. He asked me to take care of some woman I've never even heard him talk about before, and he made me promise I'd do it. It was as if he couldn't let himself die until I swore I'd take care of her."<br><br>Ray frowned. "Who's the woman? And what did he mean by 'take care of?"<br><br>Laura reached into her jeans pocket for the scrap of paper, which she flattened on the table. "Sarah Tolley," she said. "She lives in Meadow Wood Village. You know, that retirement home?"<br><br>Ray turned away from her to pour himself more coffee. He was quiet, and she imagined that he, too, was trying to puzzle out her father's request. His body looked thick and shapeless beneath the robe. Too heavy. It wasn't healthy to carry around so much weight. She wished he'd take better care of himself.<br><br>"And you don't know her connection to Carl?" he asked finally, his back still to her.<br><br>"I have no idea. He said she's a special friend. Or important. I don't remember his exact words. He could barely speak." The conversation with her father now seemed vague, as if she'd dreamed it. "He said, or at least implied, that she has no one else to take care of her. No family."<br><br>"Sweetheart." Ray sat down at the ancient oak table and rested his hand on top of hers. "I think this was the ranting of a dying man," he said. "You know he's suffered from dementia on and off this past week. The medication&#x2014;"<br><br>"I know, but he seemed clearheaded about this. You should have seen him, Ray. It was so important to him. And where would he get this name from?" She pulled her hand from his to touch the scrap of paper. "She must mean something to him. Maybe he had another life we knew nothing about. I'm going to call Meadow Wood Village later today to see if this woman actually lives there."<br><br>Ray's expression was the one he wore when he lobbied politicians on Capitol Hill. She saw the calculated patience in his face, the tightness in his lips, and knew he was choosing his words with care.<br><br>"It's probably not a good time to discuss this," he said, his tone even, his hand on hers again, "because you're understandably upset and feeling pretty emotional about Carl. But I really want you to think about the fact that he ran your life when he was alive and now he's trying to control it from the grave."<br><br>She knew what he was talking about. Sometimes her father's love had seemed tied to her achievements, and, no matter what she accomplished, it was never quite enough. But it seemed harsh, almost cruel, for Ray to imply that her father's deathbed wish was a final act of manipulation.<br><br>She leaned toward her husband, feeling tears fill her eyes. "This is the last thing my father will ever ask of me," she said. "I promised him I'd do as he requested, Ray, and I will. I don't know what this&#x2014;" she looked at the piece of paper "&#x2014;Sarah Tolley was to him, but there is no way I can simply turn my back on her."<br><br>"Damn it!" Ray slammed his mug on the table so hard she jumped, and coffee splashed onto the white place mat. He stood up. "Here you go again, throwing yourself off the deep end headfirst. Don't you have enough to do? Aren't Emma and I ever enough to satisfy you?"<br><br>Startled by his outburst, she could not find her voice. She stared at her husband while he plowed ahead.<br><br>"Why do you always need to have a million projects going at once?" he asked. "Have you looked at your life lately? You just got back from a month of research in Brazil, you drive to Baltimore to teach at Hopkins one day a week, you're overextended at the Smithsonian, and last week you told me you're going back to Brazil next summer. What happened to your promise to <em>us, </em>huh?" He leaned on the table, his hands balled into fists. His knuckles were white.<br><br>Laura reached out to touch his hand, confused by his sudden, dramatic change of heart. "But you said it was fine for me to&#x2014;"<br><br>"You said we could spend next summer at the lake house, just the three of us," he interrupted her. "Like a normal family, instead of one where the wife and mother drags her kid all over the place, chasing comets and traveling around the world giving speeches and accepting awards and who knows what other crap, while her husband sits home and gets rejection letter after fucking rejection letter." He stood up and wiped the back of his hand across his chin. The white bristles of his beard stood out against the red of his face.<br><br>Laura pressed her fist to her mouth, stunned by his uncharacteristic fury. He'd never spoken to her this way before, never uttered a word of complaint about her career. She'd had no idea his unhappiness with her ran so deep.<br><br>"Mommy?"<br><br></p><h2>Weeds in Winter</h2><p>Paperback, PP.252, Line Specimen Drawings By The Author</p><p></p><h2>If You Lived in the Alaska Territory</h2><p>Vivid illustrations and a question-and-answer text bring to life the traditions, customs, and everyday world of Eskimos many years before Alaska became a state, and includes the pronunciation of many Eskimo words.

In April 1925, Tschiffely set out with two native Argentine horses, Mancho and Gato, and with rugged determination, the trio traversed the Pampas, scaled the Bolivian Andes, struggled through Peruvian sands, swam the crocodile-infested rivers of Columbia, and fought their way through the jungles of Panama. They crossed Central America through countries devastated by years of war to finally reach Washington D.C., followed by a reception in New York. The three had been together, exclusively, for more than two years; during that time, Tschiffely developed a remarkable relationship with his horses&#x2014;an affinity that has seldom been equaled.

She lives in Clear Lake, Iowa.The Midwest in the 1920s is the setting for this romantic melodrama featuring the spunky, independent little sister of Julie Jones, the heroine of another Garlock novel, The Edge of Town. Jill Jones has recently come from Missouri to the boomtown of Rainwater, Okla., to help her ailing Aunt Justine run her hotel, a former house of ill repute. Shortly after her arrival, her flirtatious childhood friend and self-appointed protector, Thad Taylor, shows up and sweet-talks his way into a job. He is wary of the attention Jill is receiving from some of the other men in town, including Hunter Westfall, a womanizing oil tycoon, and Lloyd Madison, a creepy lawyer with "the mark of the devil" on his face and a longstanding vendetta against Justine. There are scads of supporting characters, including Radna, Justine's devoted mixed-race housekeeper, and Laura Hopper, an attractive young widow who catches Westfall's eye. Things turn grim when Thad and Jill discover the remains of a badly mutilated young woman buried in the sand. The detailed depiction of the Oklahoma oil town lends an air of authenticity, as does the colorful (if at times overdone) period slang. Garlock is most entertaining when she focuses on the love affairs percolating among the cast members, but the murder-mystery subplot feels out of place and the identity of the killer is obvious from the beginning. Overproduction may be cramping Garlock's style-her last novel, High on a Hill, came out in June of this year.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Portfolios of Ansel Adams</h2><p>A classic collection of the acclaimed photographer&#39;s limited edition portfolios, now available in a gorgeous trade paperback edition.</p><p>In a career that spanned more than five decades, Ansel Adams was at once America's foremost landscape photographer and one of its most ardent environmentalists. <br><br>John Szarkowski is Director Emeritus of the Department of Photography, The Museum of Modern Art, New York.

But was he? Some scholars deny that he existed at all. Did he? This challenging book examines the written and archaeological evidence critically in an effort to paint an accurate picture of one of the Bible&#39;s central figures.&#34;--BOOK JACKET. From The Critics Library Journal Halpern (Jewish studies, Pennsylvania State Univ.) has given us a scholarly, fascinating, and controversial study of the figure of David in the Hebrew Scriptures. He does not doubt the actual existence of a historical figure named David, as does Thomas Thompson in his Early History of the Israelite People (Brill, 2001). However, he argues that the historical David was a far different person than the one pictured in 1 and 2 Second Samuel. The controversial nature of this study can be seen in the title of one of the chapters: &#34;King David, Serial Killer.&#34; Halpern presents a close textual analysis of the stories about David in 1 Samuel 8 through 2 Samuel 1, along with a special study of 2 Samuel 8. He builds his case around the idea that there were two sources, identified here as A and B, which were used for the final versions of 1 and 2 Samuel. While Source A shows some of his faults, Source B is a kind of whitewashing apology for David in order to justify the kingship of Solomon and his successors. The real David, Halpern thinks, was a ruthless individual who was willing to murder or have murdered all of Saul&#39;s family so that he could secure the throne. Sure to receive much scholarly attention, Halpern&#39;s work can be profitably read by lay persons and scholars alike. Recommended for both public and academic libraries.

But was he? Some scholars deny that he existed at all. Did he? This challenging book examines the written and archaeological evidence critically in an effort to paint an accurate picture of one of the Bible's central figures.<p>Neither defending nor rejecting the traditions about David, Baruch Halpern, a leading scholar of biblical history and the ancient Near East, traces the origins and development of David's persona. Because the biblical text clearly responds to concerns that can only be contemporary with David himself, we can believe that David was both real and a central actor in the historical drama of ancient Israel. Yet at the same time, the written record also shows that contemporaries understood David's character to be much more unsavory than the tradition has hitherto allowed.</p><p>Halpern digs beneath the layers of tradition to understand David as an individual, as a person. The man he uncovers turns out to have been complex, ambiguous, and--above all--surprising. According to Halpern, the image of David grew over time. He was the founder of the dynasty that perpetuated the texts about him, and they progressively exaggerated his accomplishments. But in the earliest writings David remains a modest figure, as this book shows for the first time. To understand David as a human being, one must keep in mind that he was primarily a politician who operated in a rough-and-tumble environment in which competitors were ready literally to slit throats.</p><p>Halpern's work raises many provocative questions: Was David an Israelite or a Philistine? Was Solomon really David's son? Did David take the throne ofIsrael by the consent or against the will of the people? How many murders did he commit on his way to the crown? Indeed, was David someone it would have been wise to even invite to dinner? The challenging arguments in "David's Secret Demons are sure to provoke all kinds of discussion among biblical scholars and general readers alike. In addition--a big bonus--Halpern's accessible, at times humorous prose will itself draw readers everywhere into the compelling story of David found between these covers.</p>Baruch Halpern is Chair in Jewish Studies and Professor of Ancient History and Religious Studies at Penn State University.

Nineteenth-century evangelicals fought for the abolition of slavery, universal suffrage, and public education. But contemporary conservative activists have defaulted on this majestic legacy, embracing instead an agenda virtually indistinguishable from the Republican Party platform. Abortion, gay marriage, intelligent design--the Religious Right is fighting, and winning, some of the most important political battles of the twentyfirst century. How has evangelical Christianity become so entrenched in partisan politics? Randall Balmer is both an evangelical Christian and a historian of American religion. Struggling to reconcile the contemporary state of evangelical faith in America with its proud tradition of progressivism, Balmer has headed to the frontlines of some of the most powerful and controversial organizations tied to the Religious Right. With a skillful combination of grassroots organization, ideological conviction, and media savvy, the leaders of the movement have mobilized millions of American evangelical Christians behind George W. Bush&#39;s hard-right political agenda. Deftly combining ethnographic research, theological reflections, and historical context, Balmer laments the trivialization of Christianity--and offers a rallying cry for liberal Christians to reclaim the noble traditions of their faith.</p><p><b>Randall Balmer</b> is Professor of American Religious History at Barnard College, Columbia University, and a visiting professor at Yale University Divinity School. Balmer has published ten books, including <i>Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory: A Journey into the Evangelical Subculture in America</i>, which was made into a three-part documentary for PBS. He lives in Woodbury, Connecticut, with his wife, Catharine Randall, who is also a professor and an author.Evangelical Christians don't have to vote Republican, force prayer in public arenas, and condemn the type of liberalism that has initiated almost every social reform we've seen in the last 100 years. A historian of American religion, the author makes his argument within a deep cultural, political, and theological context. Jeff Woodman seems to admire these ideas, reflecting the educated indignation in the writing, which shows how we have come to condemn people who support the First Amendment, embrace a diverse society, and believe in government's responsibility to help the least among us. Strengthened by the clarity and urgency of Woodman's reading, the lesson will please at many levels and open minds to a less barbaric form of political discourse.

Lieberman is professor of history at LaGuardia Community College of the City University of New York and director of the LaGuardia and Wagner Archives.From 1853 until 1972, when their company was sold to CBS, successive generations of Steinways produced the instrument that became synonymous with the word piano. Drawing on the collection of Steinway papers at the LaGuardia and Wagner Archives, Lieberman, professor of history at New York City's LaGuardia Community College, tells the story of this dynasty of strong-willed businessmen who set out to make the world's best piano, learned to market it brilliantly and built an empire in spite of financial setbacks, labor disputes and family feuds. After the death in 1896 of William Steinway, who led the company through its most prosperous period, the legacy became increasingly difficult to maintain. The account of the long struggle waged by William's son Theodore, who headed the company from 1927 to 1955, to keep Steinway going in spite of the Depression, labor disputes, WWII and competition from upright pianos is especially sad. Finally, unable to withstand competition from foreign piano makers, Theodore's son Henry sold the company. Lieberman's lucid book, based on different material than was D.W. Fostle's The Steinway Saga, published earlier this year, is equally absorbing.

It&#x2019;s a personal story that you won&#x2019;t soon forget. Emily first became intrigued by forensics work when, as a respected medical illustrator, she was called in by the local police to create a model of a murder victim&#x2019;s face. Her fascination with that case led to a dramatic midlife career change: She would go back to school to become a forensic anthropologist&#x2014;and one of the most respected and best-known &#x201c;bone hunters&#x201d; in the nation. <br>As a student working with the FBI in Waco, Emily helped uncover definitive proof that many of the Branch Davidians had been shot to death before the fire, including their leader, David Koresh, whose bullet-pierced skull she reconstructed with her own hands. Upon graduation, Emily landed a prestigious full-time job as forensic anthropologist for the Commonwealth of Kentucky, a state with an alarmingly high murder rate and thousands of square miles of rural backcountry, where bodies are dumped and discovered on a regular basis. But even with her work there, Emily has been regularly called to investigations across the country, including the site of the terrorist attack on the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City, where a mysterious body part&#x2014;a dismembered leg&#x2014;was found at the scene and did not match any of the known <br>victims. Through careful scientific analysis, Emily was able to help identify the leg&#x2019;s owner, a pivotal piece of evidence that helped convict Timothy McVeigh.<br><br>In September 2001, Emily received a phone call summoning her to New York City, where she directed the night-shift triage at the World Trade Center&#x2019;s body identification site, collaborating with forensics experts from all over the country to collect and identify the remains of September 11 victims.<br><br>From the biggest news stories of our time to stranger-than-true local mysteries, these are unforgettable stories from the case files of Emily Craig&#x2019;s remarkable career.</p><p>Dr. Emily Craig holds a Ph.D. in forensic anthropology and is the state forensic anthropologist for the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the only such full-time state position in the country. She has been profiled on such shows as Fox&#x2019;s America&#x2019;s Most Wanted, A&amp;E&#x2019;s Cold Case Files, the Discovery Channel&#x2019;s The New Detectives, Lifetime&#x2019;s Unsolved Mysteries, CBS&#x2019;s 48 Hours, NBC&#x2019;s Extra, and the History Channel.

A couple of bass fishermen had found some decomposed and partially skeletonized remains on the edge of West Point Lake, one of the huge Chattahoochee River impoundments that separate the lower portions of Alabama and Georgia. The man had been shot in the head and his body had washed up onto the riverbank. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) had been working the case, but after several weeks, they still had no identification for the victim, and it looked as if this murder might be headed for the cold-case files.<br><br>I was still a civilian then, a medical illustrator at a nearby orthopedic clinic, but the police thought I might be able to help by doing a clay facial reconstruction of the victim. When police officers escorted me into the forensic morgue for the first time, I had my first whiff of the smell of decayed human flesh. It was like nothing I'd ever experienced, and I felt an overpowering sense of repulsion. Yet I was also drawn to the mass of bone and decaying tissue that once had been a man&#x2014;I'd never seen anything like it before. It was slimy and grayish, with bits of bone and rotting leaves and twigs sticking up randomly from a form that I could still recognize as human&#x2014;but this form had flattened, melted into the black vinyl of the body bag.<br><br>As the investigators began to tell me what they knew, I was amazed at how much they'd already learned simply from examining the remains. Enough pelvic soft tissue remained to reveal that this victim was a man; and the coroner, Don Kilgore, had estimated his height from the size label sewn into the trouser remnants that still clung to his leg bones. Now Don gently held the head, which had decomposed down to bare bone, and he showed me the bullet hole, explaining how he could tell where the bullet had entered the man's head, and at what angle. Don had been lucky: He'd recovered a .45-caliber bullet from inside the skull. If police could only link a suspect to the victim, they might be able to solve the crime by comparing bullet evidence.<br><br>But the first step, as in every murder investigation, was to identify the victim. Don pointed to some fillings in the man's teeth. If they could just get someone to suggest a name for the victim, he told me, they could probably match the man's teeth to a missing person's dental records. They were starting to lose hope, though. This victim's remains had been here in the morgue for way too long already, and so far no one had come forward with a name.<br><br>That's where I came in. At the time, I was dating a detective, Brian McGarr, and all I knew of crime was what I'd heard from him, as he kept me up nights with long, grisly stories of his latest homicide cases. He, in turn, had the incredible good luck to hear all about my exciting work as a medical artist and sculptor, which he at least had the good grace to pretend to find fascinating. Still, maybe he was more interested than I thought. When the West Point case continued to go unsolved, he was the one to suggest to the GBI and the Muscogee County coroner that they commission me to do the facial reconstruction that might help them identify their victim.<br><br>Brian and I had a relationship that nicely blended the personal and the professional. He was able to share with me confidential information about police work because I was a volunteer emergency medical technician (EMT) on the local ambulance squad, which gave me an insider's knowledge of the grisly facts surrounding some of his murder cases. Both Brian and I had spent time in the privileged zone behind the yellow crime scene tape, so we understood that unauthorized release of confidential information was forbidden. Still, when professional ethics allowed, we would sit on my back porch for hours hammering out different scenarios that could have caused specific injuries. Sometimes we'd even act out the cases, taking turns playing "killer" and "victim." When Brian had to testify in court, I'd help him mentally prepare by acting as devil's advocate, pummeling him with questions that challenged his findings at the crime scene. I could also add anatomical facts that supported&#x2014;or, sometimes, refuted&#x2014;his interpretation of the victim's fatal injuries. Those conversations were where I first learned to think like a detective. I like to think that, at the same time, Brian was learning to think like a scientist.<br><br>Certainly, when it came to analyzing a crime scene and events that led to a murder, Brian was the undisputed expert. But once he realized that my formal training as a medical illustrator enabled me to figure out bullet trajectories and other injury patterns just by reading the autopsy reports, he knew my input was just as valuable as his. At the time, I had no idea that these late-night conversations were actually expanding my understanding of human anatomy and laying the groundwork for a future in forensic anthropology and law enforcement.<br><br>A few months before, I'd had my first experience as part of a law enforcement team. Brian had recommended me to do a drawing for an upcoming murder trial. This drawing became a pivotal piece of evidence, enabling prosecutors to demonstrate the pattern of a victim's stab wounds: The injured man was defending himself, not initiating an attack, as the murderer claimed. The D.A. won his case.<br>It was a heady experience for me, as well. To produce my drawing, I'd been given access to confidential information, and I even became involved with prosecution strategy. The excitement was intoxicating, and I found myself rethinking my current career as a medical illustrator, which began to seem humdrum and predictable by comparison. Brian knew how much I'd come to yearn for something new and exciting, which may have been why he recommended me for the facial reconstruction job.<br><br>Still, flattered though I was, I wanted to say no. An anatomical drawing for a trial was one thing. But a sculpture for an ongoing investigation? First of all, I wasn't trained in the technique. Second, this was serious stuff. If I got it wrong, I might ruin their last chance to crack the case.<br><br>I wanted to help, though, and I thought I could at least do a little liaison work. So I called Betty Pat Gatliff, a friend and medical illustrator who was also one of the world's best-known forensic sculptors. Her lectures at conferences had fascinated me for years. I'd hung on her every word as she described her work in helping to identify some of the twenty-eight victims of the serial killer John Wayne Gacy, as well as victims of the Green River Killer. One of her first success stories concerned a young Native American who had disappeared years before. Betty Pat produced a facial reconstruction that bore an incredible likeness to the victim and led to the man's positive identification. This brought her more referrals from medical examiners across the country.<br><br>On one referral, she actually used her knowledge of human skulls to uncover a flaw in the initial investigation. Skeletal remains and the victim's clothing had been discovered in a remote section of the Southwest, and the victim's bra, lace panties, and high-heeled pumps were collected along with the bones. Naturally, the detectives assumed the victim was female. But when Betty Pat was brought in to do one of her now-famous facial reconstructions, she realized that the skull may have actually belonged to a man. Further forensic anthropology analysis proved her right, and the detectives went on to identify the remains as those of a man who secretly cross-dressed and who had apparently been killed when a prospective lover discovered the deception.<br><br>Now, when I approached Betty Pat about the West Point case, she was just as pleasant as I'd remembered--but not very encouraging. "My plate is fuller than full," she said apologetically. "I couldn't get to this case for at least a year. Why don't you take my course and do it yourself?"<br><br>Me? Attend a workshop on forensic sculpture? I was working full-time at a clinic specializing in sports medicine. How could I fit a whole other course of study into my schedule? Still, I was intrigued&#x2014;and tempted. I haltingly told Betty Pat that I'd think about coming to her class, not realizing how much that conversation would change my life.<br>Looking back, I realize that, in many ways, my talk with Betty Pat was merely the next step in a journey I'd been on since childhood. For as long as I can remember, I have been blessed&#x2014;or maybe cursed&#x2014;with an insatiable curiosity about the human body. Call me crazy, but my idea of a good time is a pile of mysterious bones to analyze, the chance to dissect the bloody knee of a freshly delivered cadaver, or maybe a long session of photographing a partially decayed face&#x2014;anything to satisfy my endless fascination with the form and function of our bones, muscles, and tendons.<br><br>As a girl growing up in Kokomo, Indiana, in the 1950s and 1960s, I was discouraged from choosing a career in science, as well as from engaging in other kinds of "boy stuff." So my fascination with science made me feel like a misfit, though given my family history, it should have made sense: My dad, his dad, and my mother's grandfather had all been doctors. How could I help myself?<br><br>My father's medical books especially fascinated me. I got his permission to take them off his library shelves&#x2014;and became hooked. Looking through those books, I felt as though I had entered into another world. I spent hours admiring the full-color renderings of what I might see inside an arm, a leg, or an abdomen. Although he never expected me to make a career in science or medicine, Dad encouraged my interest in those books. I guess he was thrilled that he could share his passion for anatomy with at least one of his four kids.<br><br>One afternoon when I was about twelve, I was out in a trout stream near a vacation cabin we owned near Baldwin, Michigan. Suddenly, I caught sight of some bones sticking out of the sandy bank. At that point in my life, it took quite a lot for me to put down my fly rod voluntarily, especially when the trout were biting. But those bones were just too intriguing. I waded over to the bank and pulled a few out of the sand. Just below, under the water, I could see that more were deeply embedded in the black muck just below the surface of the streambed. I was sure that I had stumbled upon a deer's antlers, some ribs, and a pelvis. That was it. I knew I couldn't leave until I had found every single piece of that skeleton.<br><br>As I searched for the smooth butter-colored bones among the rocks and sticks at the bottom of the creek, I completely lost track of time. When I suddenly realized that it was starting to get dark, I knew my parents would be frantic. I stuffed all the bones that would fit into my wicker creel, the basket for carrying the fish I'd caught, and thrust the others into a sack I had improvised out of my rain poncho. I reached the path back to our cabin in record time, just as my dad showed up to look for me.<br><br>Before Dad could scold me for being late, I dumped the bones at his feet and breathlessly asked him to help me reassemble them, figuring that any doctor could put a skeleton together without thinking twice. But Dad had no idea where to start. He knew where every bone was located while in the body, but assembling skeletons hadn't been part of his training. Out of context, the bones just didn't make any sense to him.<br><br>That was one time my dad couldn't help me. But he was wise enough to see that I had found something that was hugely important to me. Even though it was nearly twilight, Dad walked me back to my fishing spot and waited quietly on the bank while I finished doing my first-ever skeletal excavation. Then he offered moral support for the next two days, as I tried to put those bones back together in our backyard.<br><br>Of course, I couldn't do it. But I promised myself that someday, somehow, I would put a skeleton back together&#x2014;and a human skeleton, too, not just an animal one.</p><h2>Uniform System of Accounts for the Lodging Industry</h2><p>Uniform System of Accounts for the Lodging Industry [Hardcover] Timothy Eaton (Author)</p><p></p><h2>Cold Shoulder Road</h2><p>When Arun&#39;s mother mysteriously disappears, Is Twite is unable to get any information from the Silent Sect she to which she belonged, and in the wake of a smuggling operation, the cousins face two evil villains.</p><p>Having freed the children enslaved in the northern mines, Is Twite and her cousin Arun return to Folkestone to find Arun&#39;s mother.

She wrote 92 novels, including 27 for adults, as well as plays, poems, and short stories. Aiken was born in East Sussex, England. Her father, Conrad Aiken, was a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning poet. She began writing at a young age, publishing her first short story when she was 17 years old. Before writing full-time, Aiken worked at the United Nations Information Centre as well as the magazine <i>Argosy</i>. It was during this time that she wrote her classic children&#x2019;s novel <i>The Wolves of Willoughby Chase</i> (1962), which won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award and was the first in a 12-book series. Her other titles for younger readers include <i>The Last Slice of Rainbow</i>, <i>The Kitchen Warriors</i>, and <i>Mice and Mendelson</i>. For older readers, her books include the Edgar Award&#x2013;winning <i>Night Fall</i>, and <i>The Scream</i>. In 1999, Aiken was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire for her services to children&#x2019;s literature. She is survived by her daughter.</p><h2>An Introduction to Pastels (Dk Art School)</h2><p>Describes the characteristics of pastels, demonstrates a variety of techniques, and looks at papers, tools, equipment, and types of pastels</p><p></p><h2>Secret History: The CIA s Classified Account of Its Operations in Guatemala, 1952-1954</h2><p>In 1992, the Central Intelligence Agency hired the young historian Nick Cullather to write a history (classified &#x201c;secret&#x201d; and for internal distribution only) of the Agency&#x2019;s Operation PBSUCCESS, which overthrew the lawful government of Guatemala in 1954. Given full access to the Agency&#x2019;s archives, he produced a vivid insider&#x2019;s account, intended as a training manual for covert operators, detailing how the C.I.A. chose targets, planned strategies, and organized the mechanics of waging a secret war. In 1997, during a brief period of open disclosure, the C.I.A. declassified the history with remarkably few substantive deletions. The <i>New York Times</i> called it &#x201c;an astonishingly frank account . . . which may be a high-water mark in the agency&#x2019;s openness.&#x201d; Here is that account, with new notes by the author which clarify points in the history and add newly available information.<br><br>In the Cold War atmosphere of 1954, the U.S. State Department (under John Foster Dulles) and the C.I.A. (under his brother Allen Dulles) regarded Guatemala&#x2019;s democratically elected leftist government as a Soviet beachhead in the Western Hemisphere. At the C.I.A.&#x2019;s direction, the government was overthrown and replaced by a military dictatorship installed by the Agency. This book tells, for the first time, how a disaster-prone operation&#x2014;marked by bad planning, poor security, and incompetent execution&#x2014;was raised to legendary status by its almost accidental triumph.<br><br>This early C.I.A. covert operation delighted both President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Dulles brothers, and Allen Dulles concluded that the apparent success in Guatemala, despite a long series of blunders, made the venture a sound model for future operations. This book reveals how the legend of PBSUCCESS grew, and why attempts to imitate it failed so disastrously at the Bay of Pigs in 1961 and in the Contra war in the 1980&#x2019;s. The Afterword traces the effects of the coup of 1954 on the subsequent unstable politics and often violent history of Guatemala.<br><br></p><p>Nick Cullather is Associate Professor of History at Indiana University.

Why do you think I've always got a couple of these in my pocket?"<br><br>I took the cigar from Mike and rolled it between my fingers.<br><br>"Don't look at the damn thing. Smoke it. That broad's been decomposing for days in an empty room during a summer heat wave. Wrap your lips around that sucker and inhale till the smoke comes through your nose and ears, and maybe even from between your toes."<br><br>I put it to my lips, coughing as the harsh tobacco taste filled my mouth and lungs. There were no overhead lights above the concrete barriers we sat on at the intersection of South Street and Whitehall, which dead-ended at the East River, near the southernmost tip of Manhattan. "There's no air out here. Not even a breeze off the water."<br><br>"Almost midnight and it's still ninety-seven degrees. She's cooking in that room," Mike said, tossing his head in the direction of the crime scene that he'd been working for the last three hours. His black hair glistened with sweat, and the perspiration on his shirt made the cotton cloth cling to his chest. "Whatever body parts were left intact will be fried by the time they bag her."<br><br>"Are you going with the guys to the morgue?" I asked.<br><br>"Might be the coolest place in town tonight. You into refrigerated boxes?"<br><br>"I'll pass. Are they almost done?"<br><br>"The ME was ready to call it quits when the maggot maven showed up."<br><br>The putrefaction of the woman's body, which had been left to rot in the abandoned government offices over the old ferry slip, offered an irresistible opportunity to swarms of summer flies, which entered to lay their eggs and leave their offspring to nourish themselves on her flesh.<br><br>The blast of the horn from the Staten Island Ferry, its giant orange hull sliding out of the pier from the enormous modern terminal just twenty yards downriver, startled me. We were half a mile south of the bustling marketplace that had once been the South Street Seaport, flanking the glittering towers of Wall Street, outside what seemed like the only building in the downtown area that had been neglected alongside the water's flotsam and jetsam.<br><br>I stood up from the concrete barrier and looked over my shoulder at the entrance to the deserted slips--three vaulted openings that led to the water, supporting a raised porch and the offices in which the body had been found, centered between forty-foot-tall columns that faced Whitehall. Crumbling wooden pilings bordered the walkway behind me, while trash floated and bobbed among the large rocks in the water ten feet below.<br><br>"Jumpy already?" Mike smiled at me as he held the open collar of his shirt between his thumb and forefinger, waving it back and forth as though the cloth might actually dry out despite the oppressive humidity. "You don't even know what happened to her yet."<br><br>"Has he got any ideas about how long the woman's been dead?" The cigar smoke filtered up through my nostrils, overwhelming the pungent odor of death.<br><br>"Bug juice, Madam Prosecutor. The good Dr. Magorski likes to bring this whole thing down to when he figures the flies laid the maggots which finished feasting and then sat on the floorboards and pupated. He's picking up the pupal cases to take to his lab. It's a slow process," Mike said, dismissing the expert with a flip of his hand.<br><br>The forensic entomologist had been called to the scene by the young medical examiner who first responded to the detectives' notification. I had watched Magorski work several other cases, clipping a pair of lenses that looked like tiny microscopes over his thick eyeglasses while he scoured the body and its surroundings for signs of insect life--with its predictable cycles that might help establish a time of death.<br><br>"I understand. But do you think he's useful?"<br><br>"I want you to keep puffing on that thing till you turn a pale shade of green."<br><br>"I feel like I'm coming up on chartreuse," I said, brushing wisps of damp hair off my forehead with the back of my hand.<br><br>"Personally, I think he's a waste of resources. Is she dead more than a week? Yeah. Less than two? My money's on that. The only reason everybody south of Forty-second Street didn't notice the odor is because this place is so isolated, except for the decaying fish remains and sewage right below where she was found."<br><br>"That's still a pretty big window of opportunity."<br><br>"Once we ID the broad, it won't take long for some joker to tell us the last time she showed up at work or a girlfriend to say what domestic tiff sped her out the door of her apartment. Stick with real detective work, kid. I never met a bug with a gold shield."<br><br>I had seen more than my share of bodies as the prosecutor in charge of the Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office for the last decade. The black humor of many cops and colleagues, an effort to defuse these ugly situations, did nothing to ease my revulsion.<br><br>"Hey, Chapman," a rookie in uniform called out to Mike from the porch of the old ferry slip. "They're bringing her out now. You and Ms. Cooper can come back up."<br><br>On the roadway opposite the aging terminal, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Drive sank below ground to loop under the Battery and reemerge as the West Side Highway. The far side of the tunnel entrance, dozens of glass and steel office towers--many of their windows still lit--formed the dense, narrow canyons of the city's financial district.<br><br>"Sorry to drag you down here. I really thought it might be your girl," Mike said. He knew I had been assigned to an unsolved case involving a young woman who'd gone missing the week before.<br><br>We watched as the MEs van backed into the loading dock and the attendant opened the rear doors, ready to receive the body bag.<br><br>"Looked like a good possibility till the wig came off and we realized her hair wasn't red," he went on.<br><br>Mike was a second-grade detective assigned to the Manhattan North Homicide Squad. His usual turf stretched from north of Fifty-ninth Street, uptown through the Harlems and the Heights to the narrow waterway that separated the island from the Bronx. But the end of summer, despite the spike in murders that usually accompanied a dramatic rise in the temperature, was also the time many cops took their vacation. The two squads, now short of manpower in late August, combined forces to respond to every murder in Manhattan.<br><br>We stopped talking when four men--one from the medical examiner's office and three uniformed officers from the First Precinct--emerged from the dark mouth of the building with their charge. There were no other spectators, no need for them to walk as though they were pallbearers, struggling to balance the coffin. The foursome loped along with the body, heaving it onto the stretcher inside the van, jerking it from side to side to position it before they strapped it into place for the ride up the drive to the morgue.<br><br>"None of these 'ologists' can help with the more important questions," Mike said as the driver slammed the double doors. He wiped the sweat from his forehead with his handkerchief, then passed it to me. "Who the hell is she? What brought her to this godforsaken place? Why hasn't anybody noticed she was out of commission before tonight? What kind of monster am I looking for? I can't even think straight it's so hot."<br><br>"No other missing-person reports?"

For six years, following the treacherous murder of his brother Javan, King Rhys Michael--feigning wine-soaked mediocrity--has been the puppet of the merciless Archbishop Hubert MacInnis and his self-proclaimed ruling Regents' Council. But then the pretender to Gwynedd's throne, Marek of Festil, provocatively attacks and occupies a remote border castle, and Rhys Michael sees an opportunity to assert his independence. Meanwhile, his hidden Deryni allies prepare to overthrow the Regents. Rhysel, a Deryni posing as Queen Michaela's maid, awakens Rhys Michael's latent Deryni powers before the King rides forth to confront the Deryni- powered Marek. In the subsequent magical duel, Rhys Michael sustains a hand injury which, denied proper Deryni healing, festers. Foreseeing his own death, he prepares a decree commanding loyal Kheldour lords to protect his infant son, Owain. Sure enough, the Regents suspect Rhys Michael of plotting against them. The big question, then: Can the Kheldour lords and their covert Deryni allies thwart the ruling Regents and save Owain? A satisfying conclusion with a persuasively grim backdrop, well-controlled fantasy elements, a solid cast, and realistically medieval dark plots and foul deeds. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>A small band of rebels attempts to overcome a tyranny of church and corrupt nobility in the rousing and tragic conclusion to Kurtz's fourth Deryni trilogy. When Marek of Festil, the bastard son of Gwynedd's last Deryni king, makes a move to gain the throne, the ruling council reluctantly allows King Rhys Michael to meet the challenge. (Having held the young man and his wife, Michaela, in their grip since arranging the deaths of his two older brothers, the nobles and high churchmen fear an assertion of independence before the king fathers a second child to assure the succession.) As Rhys Michael travels to Culliecairn to meet with Marek, another group of the now-proscribed Deryni seek to awaken the psychic powers of the king and queen through Michaela's young maid, Liesel. With strong characterizations and sustained tension, this volume once again reflects the atmospheric gloom of a dark and secret land, full of treachery and cruelty but shot through with light and a promise of hope. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Lord is My Shepherd</h2><p>The 23rd Psalm is illuminated through bright illustrations in this inspirational picture book for young readers of all ages.</p><p>Gennady Spirin lives in Princeton, NJ.Grade 3 Up&#x2014;Spirin has applied his unique artistic vision to the venerated Old Testament psalm. He isolates harmonious images from his elegant portrait of an ornately robed and turbaned dignitary, which appears at the back of the book, to illuminate each line. The harp-playing man occupies a gold and ivory temple surrounded by a sapphire sea, a sumptuous feast spread out at his feet. Other figures, including farmers reaping a field of hay and a cavalry of armored soldiers, populate the perimeter of the canvas. The imaginative and dreamlike scene features a multitude of birds, flowers, animals, soaring spires, and angels all painted in rich jewel tones. The text is presented one line at a time in a large, clear font on an image of an ornate scroll, and each accompanying illustration is framed in gold. The opening lines, "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want," are paired with a tranquil scene of the white-robed shepherd watching over his flock while a young boy plays a wooden flute and a majestic lion lies peacefully among the sheep. The entire psalm appears on the last page, along with a fold-out reproduction of Spirin's distinctive oil painting. This sophisticated interpretation of the psalm has an ethereal, fairy-tale quality, contrasting with Barry Moser's <i>Psalm 23</i> (Zonderkidz, 2008). Moser illustrates the sacred lines with shimmering watercolors of a cheerful Antiguan boy tending his flock in idyllic Caribbean landscapes. While Moser's paintings may appeal more to younger children, older readers will treasure Spirin's exquisite interpretation and enjoy locating the individual illustrations in the larger work of art.&#x2014;<i>Linda L.

The first formal educational system? The first tax cut? The first love song? The answers were found in excavations of ancient Sumer, a society so developed, resourceful, and enterprising that it, in a sense, created history.

Reprint.</p><p>Here&#39;s something different: a vampire novel that&#39;s light, funny, and not at all hackneyed. Between scenes of punks bowling frozen turkeys on the graveyard shift in a supermarket, or snapping turtles loose in a loft and gnawing on designer shoes, this novel has comic charm to spare. But it also packs an appealingly downbeat message about the consumer culture: Becoming a vampire has given the twentysomething heroine &#34;a crampless case of rattlesnake PMS&#34;--a grumpy mood in which she realizes that she can dress to the nines as a &#34;Donner Party Barbie&#34; and still end up disillusioned and unhappy, just another slacker doing her own laundry and watching sucky TV &#39;til the sun rises.Christopher Moore is the author of five previous novels.

Mr. Cart lives in Columbus, Indiana. </p>A companion volume of sorts to his What's So Funny? Wit and Humor in American Children's Literature, this new work from Cart chronicles the evolution of the young-adult novel from its first appearance as a recognized category of literature in the 1960s to its somewhat tenuous role in the 1990s. Despite arguments questioning the necessity of works written specifically for a YA readership, Cart supports this art form with examples of successes and failures, and a wealth of comment from popular authors in the field. He handily dismisses book series in the romance and horror genres and critiques what he considers shortcomings of such "reality" based classics as The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton and The Pigman by Paul Zindel. On the flip side, Cart positively gushes about his favorite writers, notably Bruce Brooks, Robert Cormier and Francesca Lia Block, each of whom he credits with masterfully presenting complex and intelligent books for a YA audience. And it is in that gritty, often bleak world?millions of miles from the pat problem novels of the 1970s?that Cart feels the future of the YA novel lies. Publishing professionals, as well as writers and students, will glean a balanced examination of such issues as homosexuality, mental illness, AIDS and drug abuse, and how they are addressed in YA books. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Thomas Hardy: The Complete Novels in One Sitting</h2><p><p>Thomas Hardy was one of the greatest Victorian novelists and twentieth-century poets, exploring themes of the human experience and challenging sexual and religious conventions in a way that few other books of his time did.

Driving a minivan and camping alone, Blocksma completed the 5000-mile journey in 90 days. Her itinerary-always following the road closest to the shore-took her to large industrial cities like Milwaukee, small artistic communities like Saugatuck, Michigan, and wildlife areas such as Isle Royale National Park, the largest island in Lake Superior. Blocksma's prose is adequate, although she occasionally produces a lovely description of the natural world. She provides few insights into what it was like for a woman to travel and camp alone. Instead, the author is a camera: she records what she sees and hears but does not reflect on it. This work may be useful as an introduction to a beautiful and diverse area of the country, but those seeking depth will have to look further.

His writing has appeared in the Harvard Business Review and other business journals.Is there a more timely topic for a business book than brilliant executives running their companies into the ground? Dartmouth business professor Finkelstein has been on the case for six years, researching how otherwise intelligent people can manage to botch things up. Here, he dredges up old corporate screwups (like R. J. Reynolds's smokeless cigarettes) and new ones, too (WorldCom and Tyco, among others). There's a certain amount of schadenfreude involved, as the author crisply and incisively picks apart disaster after disaster, but the lessons drawn from this lengthy study are, for the most part, vastly unsurprising. While each company profiled tends to fail in its own way, there are common traits among top execs, such as a propensity to eliminate "anyone who isn't 100 percent behind them" and to "underestimate major obstacles." While Finkelstein suggests avoiding such destructive behaviors, the truth is, sometimes it's human nature to be blind to one's own weaknesses.

It discusses such qestions as: what are the myths that surround her?; how can we define and understand the aspects of the Divine Feminine?; what is the role of polarity and the relevance of the Goddess for both men and women today?; how can we work with her as a living force?; and how can the Black Goddess aspect help us to heal both ourselves and the contemporary world?</p><p></p><h2>The Shaman&#39;s Game (Shaman Mysteries)</h2><p>On a parched plain, encircled by a dry embrace of willow bones, the ritual begins. Here, there is searing heat, bleeding feet, unimaginable thirst This is the Sun Dance. <p>Author James D. Doss blends spinetingling mystery with Native American mysticism as no one else can. Through his expert and justifiably acclaimed storytelling abilities, two very different worlds come together: the modern world, where human greed, anger, and jealousies can drive mortal men and women to commit terrible crimes; and the spirit world of dreams and omens, and a Power older than civilization. The former is the realm of tribal policeman Charlie Moon and his sometime associate Granite Creek, Colorado, Police Chief Scott Parris. The latter is the province of Charlie's aunt Daisy Perika, Ute elder and shaman. </p><p>For the Ute of Southern Colorado, the annual Sun Dance is among the most solemn and sacred of rituals. But too often recently Death has been an uninvited guest at the hallowed ceremony. None of the deceased has sustained visible, life-ending injuries, so Charlie Moon is reluctant to call it murder. Yet he knows there was nothing "natural" about the unexplained deaths of young and strong dancers, like the blue-armed Shoshone, Joseph Sparrow. </p><p>Daisy Perika is also aware of the events unfolding around her, but unlike her skeptical policeman nephew, she trusts the rumors of sorcery that travel like smoke on the wind. For there is much the eyes cannot see and the hands cannot touch; and the spirits have sent her words and signs warning there is great evil in her midst. . .and that there are many more corpses to follow. </p><p>The return of a childhood friend--a beautiful Ute woman back from college to write a newspaper story revealing who, or what, is stealing men's lives--has raised the stakes in Charlie Moon's investigation.

Doss, recently retired from the technical staff of Los Alamos National Laboratory, now spends most of his time in a small cabin above Taos -- writing mystery fiction. He also travels to the fascinating locations where his stories take place, often camping in remote areas to absorb the impression of an Anasazi ruin, a deep canyon, an arid mesa, or a Sun Dance. His Shaman series includes <em>The Shaman Sings</em>, <em>The Shaman Laughs</em>, <em>The Shaman's Bones</em>, <em>The Shaman's Game</em>, <em>The Night Visitor</em>, and <em>Grandmother Spider</em>. The unusual plots are a mix of high technology and mysticism (<em>Shaman Sings</em>), bizarre animal mutilations (<em>Shaman Laughs</em>), theft of a sacred artifact (<em>Shaman's Bones</em>), an unprecedented form of murder and revenge at the Sun Dance (<em>Shaman's Game</em>), a most peculiar haunting followed by the discovery of an astonishing fossil (<em>Night Visitor</em>), and -- because a small girl has killed a spider without performing the prescribed ritual -- the appearance of a monstrous, murderous, eight-legged creature on the reservation (<em>Grandmother Spider</em>, of course!).For the Ute Indians of southwestern Colorado, the Sun Dance is a quest for healing and connection with the higher power. It is also a physically punishing ritual. When three people die during two dances, tribal police officer Charlie Moon (in the fourth captivating book of this exceptional series, after The Shaman's Bones, 1997) can't quite accept the verdicts of natural causes. Moon's aunt, elderly shaman Daisy Perika, dreams that the victims were targets of a witch. A lovely but frail young Ute woman, Delly Sands, recently returned to the reservation and working for the tribal newspaper, thinks that her reporting will unmask the witch. When Delly herself is wounded in an attack with a weapon that has powerful tribal symbolism, Moon must take Aunt Daisy's warning more seriously. The old shaman determines to expose the witch on her own, a "game" that could cause more deaths. As in the previous Shaman stories, Doss skillfully navigates the tricky terrain between fact and fable, as Moon balances clear-eyed cop logic with timeless tribal beliefs that can make their own reality. The Sun Dance scenes are spellbinding, rendered with powerful conviction and knowledgeable respect. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>At The Hour of Death</h2><p>At The Hour of Death</p><p></p><h2>David Hockney</h2><p>David Hockney (b. 1937) has been delighting and challenging art lovers for almost 60 years. Working in a wide range of media with wit and intelligence, his art has examined, probed, and questioned how the perceived world of movement, space, and time can be captured in two dimensions. This stunning monograph and the retrospective exhibition it accompanies explore Hockney&#x2019;s entire career, allowing an overview of his constantly evolving style and exploring his return to favored themes. From abstract expressionism to naturalism to his play with illusion and imagination, parody, and self-reflexivity, Hockney&#x2019;s preoccupation with looking, perception, and representation can be traced throughout. Showcasing more than 200 works in all media from across the six decades of Hockney&#x2019;s remarkable career, this book will delight existing fans of the artist while giving new audiences the fullest possible introduction to his life and work.&nbsp;&nbsp; The book is the catalogue for the acclaimed exhibition originating at Tate Britain in February 2017 and traveling to the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.</p><p><b>Chris Stephens</b> is head of Displays and lead curator, Modern British Art, and <b>Andrew Wilson</b> is curator, Contemporary Art and Archives, both at Tate Britain.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Triage</h2><p>Three masters of horror unite in this collection of interconnected novellas that each start with someone walking into a workplace with a gun, launching an odyssey into a nightmarish world of fear and madness. Original.</p><p>A whacko walking into a workplace after first making a threatening phone call ("I'm gonna get you") serves as the premise for each of the three novellas in this grisly anthology. Fans of the late Richard Laymon will revel in his characteristic mix of horror and sadism in the title story, in which a shotgun-toting psycho wreaks havoc in a law office. A secretary named Sharon flees, gains help from a stranger and returns to the office, where she discovers a heap of bodies, the killer beneath. The killer pops out, shoots Sharon's rescuer, sexually assaults her and escapes the police but not her ultimate revenge. Just another day in the office. In Edward Lee's "In the Year of Our Lord: 2202," his heroine, also named Sharon, lives in a Christianized future world. When the threatening message comes, she reacts quickly enough to call in the securitechs, who blast the intruder away, along with the story, which abruptly shifts into another theme. After an explanation of how things got so religious, with outbursts of four-star profanity by the less godly characters and gobs of SF babble by the sardonic author, the plot plows along to a predictable ending. Jack Ketchum's "Sheep Meadow Story," the best and the shortest of the three contributions, opens with the by-now-familiar bloody scenario, but it proves to be the dream of a disgruntled editor paid to critique and encourage the work of talentless would-be authors. The story is a funny riff on literary ambition, while the inevitable gunplay surprises hero and reader alike. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>L.A.

Based on 20 years of research as an applied kinesiologist and bionutritionist, Mein concludes that each human is born with a dominant gland, organ, or system that corresponds to one of 25 specific body types. She also believes each body type manifests itself in unique physical characteristics and psychological traits. Here, Mein attempts to help readers identify their own body type, understand its specific needs (according to her empirical research), and implement a diet tailored to meeting those needs. <p> Opening and scanning the book proves great fun, especially for those who love delving into parallel studies like astrology or numerology. Trouble is, the task of accurately identifying a body type is easier said than done. As readers peruse hundreds of black-and-white photos of scantily clad adult bodies, "unique" doesn't always look so unique--even with help from the corresponding personality profiles. So, while Mein earnestly strives to offer a solution to the one-diet-fits-all myth, her own theory begs the question: Are we all so predictable and categorical? The flip side, of course, is that anyone who finds a perfect match of physical and psychological traits (for instance, an "Adrenal Female" who has a solid boyish figure, thrives on excitement, is competitive and ever in charge) will receive very specific marching orders from Dr. Mein. To each body type, she dedicates about six pages of notes, including a lengthy personality profile, guidelines for dietary intake, healthy and unhealthy foods, ideal meal scheduling, and a sample one-week menu. <i>--Liane Thomas</i></p>Carolyn Mein, D.C., began her chiropractic practice in 1974.

Temujin&#x2019;s young life was shaped by a series of brutal acts: the betrayal of his father by a neighboring tribe and the abandonment of his entire family, cruelly left to die on the harsh plain. But Temujin endured&#x2014;and from that moment on, he was driven by a singular fury: to survive in the face of death, to kill before being killed, and to conquer enemies who could come without warning from beyond the horizon.<br> <br> Through a series of courageous raids against the Tartars, Temujin&#x2019;s legend grew. And so did the challenges he faced&#x2014;from the machinations of a Chinese ambassador to the brutal abduction of his young wife, Borte.

He lives with his wife and three children in Hertfordshire, England.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i><i>Chapter One</i><br>ON A SPRING DAY in his twelfth year, Temujin raced his four brothers across the steppes, in the shadow of the mountain known as Deli&#x2019;un-Boldakh. The eldest, Bekter, rode a gray mare with skill and concentration, and Temujin matched his pace, waiting for a chance to go past. Behind them came Khasar, whooping wildly as he moved up on the two leaders. At ten, Khasar was a favorite in the tribe, as lighthearted as Bekter was sullen and dark. His red-mottled stallion snorted and whickered after Bekter&#x2019;s mare, making the little boy laugh. Kachiun came next in the galloping line, an eight-year-old not given to the openness that made people love Khasar. Of all of them, Kachiun seemed the most serious, even secretive. He spoke only rarely and did not complain, no matter what Bekter did to him. Kachiun had a knack with the ponies that few others could match, able to nurse a burst of speed when the rest were flagging. Temujin glanced over his shoulder to where Kachiun had positioned himself, his balance perfect. He seemed to be idling along, but they had all been surprised before and Temujin kept a close eye on him.<br><br>Already some way behind his brothers, the smallest and youngest of them could be heard calling plaintively for them to wait. Temuge was a boy with too much love for sweet things and laziness, and it showed in his riding. Temujin grinned at the sight of the chubby boy flapping his arms for more speed. Their mother had warned against including the youngest in their wild tournaments. Temuge had barely grown out of the need to be tied to the saddle, but he wailed if they left him behind. Bekter had yet to find a kind word for Temuge.<br><br>Their high voices carried far across the spring grass of the plain. They galloped flat out, with each boy perched like a bird on the ponies&#x2019; backs. Yesugei had once called them his sparrows and looked on with pride at their skill. Temujin had told Bekter that he was too fat to be a sparrow and had been forced to spend a night hiding out from the older boy&#x2019;s bad temper.<br><br>On such a day, though, the mood of the whole tribe was light. The spring rains had come and the rivers ran full again, winding across plains where dry clay had been only days before. The mares had warm milk for drinking and making into cheese and cool yoghurt. Already, the first touches of green were showing through the bones of the hills, and with it came the promise of a summer and warm days. It was a gathering year, and before the next winter, the tribes would come together in peace to compete and trade. Yesugei had decreed that this year the families of the Wolves would make the trip of more than a thousand miles to replenish their herds. The prospect of seeing the wrestlers and archers was enough to have the boys on their best behavior. The races, though, were what held them rapt and played across their imaginations as they rode. Except for Bekter, the boys had all seen their mother privately, asking Hoelun to put in a word with Yesugei. Each of them wanted to race the long distance or the sprints, to make a name for themselves and be honored.<br><br>It went unspoken that a boy who returned to his gers with a title such as &#x201c;Exalted Rider&#x201d; or &#x201c;Master of Horse&#x201d; might one day win their father&#x2019;s position when he retired to tend his herds. With the possible exception of fat Temuge, the others could not help but dream. It galled Temujin that Bekter assumed he would be the one, as if a year or two of age made a difference. Their relationship had become strained ever since Bekter had returned from his betrothal year away from the tribe. Though Temujin was still the tallest of the brothers, the older boy had grown in some indefinable way, and Temujin had found the new Bekter a humorless companion.<br><br>It had seemed an act at first to Temujin, with Bekter only pretending at maturity. The brooding boy no longer spoke without thinking and seemed to weigh every statement in his mind before he allowed it past his lips. Temujin had mocked his seriousness, but the months of winter had come and gone with no sign of an easing. There were moments when Temujin still found his brother&#x2019;s pompous moods amusing, but he could respect Bekter&#x2019;s temper, if not his right to inherit their father&#x2019;s tents and sword.<br><br>Temujin watched Bekter as he rode, careful not to let a gap grow between them. It was too fine a day to worry about the distant future, and Temujin daydreamed about all four brothers, brothers&#x2013;all five with Bekter, even&#x2013;sweeping the board of honors at the tribal gathering. Yesugei would swell with pride and Hoelun would grip them one by one and call them her little warriors, her little horsemen. Even Temuge could be entered at six years of age, though the risks of a fall were huge. Temujin frowned to himself as Bekter glanced over his shoulder, checking his lead. Despite their subtle maneuvering, Yesugei had not yet given permission for any of them to take part as the spring came.<br><br>Hoelun was pregnant again and close to the end of her time. The pregnancy had been hard on her and quite different from the ones before. Each day began and ended with her retching over a bucket until her face was speckled with spots of blood under the skin. Her sons were on their best behavior while they waited for Yesugei to cease his worried pacing outside the gers. In the end, the khan had grown tired of their stares and careful silence, sending them off to run the winter out of the horses. Temujin had continued to chatter and Yesugei had picked him up in one powerful hand and tossed him at a stallion with a white sock. Temujin had twisted in the air to land and launch into a gallop in one movement. Whitefoot was a baleful, snappy beast, but his father had known he was the boy&#x2019;s favorite.<br><br>Yesugei had watched the others mount without a sign of his pride on his broad, dark face. Like his father before him, he was not a man to show emotion, especially not to sons he could make weak. It was part of a father&#x2019;s responsibility to be feared, though there were times when he ached to hug the boys and throw them up into the air. Knowing which horses they preferred showed his affection, and if they guessed at his feelings from a glance or a light in his eye, that was no more than his own father had done years before. He valued those memories in part for their rarity and could still recall the time his father had finally grunted approval at his knots and ropework with a heavy load. It was a small thing, but Yesugei thought of the old man whenever he yanked a rope tight, his knee hard into the bales. He watched his boys ride into the bright sunshine, and when they could no longer see him, his expression eased. His father had known the need for hard men in a hard land. Yesugei knew they would have to survive battle, thirst, and hunger if they were to reach manhood. Only one could be khan of the tribe. The others would either bend the knee or leave with just a wanderer&#x2019;s gift of goats and sheep. Yesugei shook his head at the thought, gazing after the dust trail of his sons&#x2019; ponies. The future loomed over them, while they saw only the spring and the green hills.<br><br>The sun was bright on his face as Temujin galloped. He reveled in the lift in spirit that came from a fast horse straining under him, the wind in his face. Ahead, he saw Bekter&#x2019;s gray mare recover from a stumble on a loose stone. His brother reacted with a sharp blow to the side of the mare&#x2019;s head, but they had lost a length and Temujin whooped as if he were about to ride past. It was not the right moment. He loved to lead, but he also enjoyed pressuring Bekter, because of the way it annoyed him.<br><br>Bekter was already almost the man he would be, with wide, muscular shoulders and immense stamina. His betrothal year with the Olkhun&#x2019;ut people had given him an aura of worldly knowledge he never failed to exploit. It irritated Temujin like a thorn under his skin, especially when his brothers pestered Bekter with questions about their mother&#x2019;s people and their customs. Temujin too wanted to know, but he decided grimly that he would wait to find out on his own, when Yesugei took him.<br><br>When a young warrior returned from his wife&#x2019;s tribe, he was given the status of a man for the first time. When the girl came into her blood, she would be sent after him with an honor guard to show her value. A ger would be ready for her and her young husband would wait at its door to take her inside.<br><br>For the Wolves, it was tradition for the young man to challenge his khan&#x2019;s bondsmen before he was fully accepted as a warrior. Bekter had been eager and Temujin remembered watching in awe as Bekter had walked up to the bondsmen&#x2019;s fire, close to Yesugei&#x2019;s ger. Bekter had nodded to them and three men had stood to see if his time with the Olkhun&#x2019;ut had weakened him. From the shadows, Temujin had watched, with Khasar and Kachiun silent at his side. Bekter had wrestled all three of the bondsmen, one after the other, taking terrible punishment without complaint. Eeluk had been the last, and the man was like a pony himself, a wall of flat muscle and wide arms. He had thrown Bekter so hard that blood had run from one of his ears, but then to Temujin&#x2019;s surprise, Eeluk had helped Bekter up and held a cup of hot black <i>airag </i>for him to drink. Bekter had almost choked at the bitter fluid mingling with his own blood, but the warriors had not seemed to mind.<br><br>Temujin had enjoyed witnessing his older brother beaten almost senseless, but he saw too that the men no longer scorned him around the fires at night. Bekter&#x2019;s courage had won him something intangible but important. As a result, he had become a stone in Temujin&#x2019;s path.

"Silvertongue") sagely says to his daughter, "Stories never really end, Meggie, even if the books like to pretend they do. Stories always go on. They don't end on the last page, any more than they begin on the first page." A fitting meta-observation for this, the unplanned second installment in Cornelia Funke's beloved now-trilogy.<p> Of course, it's that sort of earnest, almost gushing veneration of books and book-loving that made the absorbing suspense-fantasy <i>Inkheart</i> so wonderful in the first place, with that lit-affection getting woven integrally into the plot (<i>Inkheart</i> being both Funke's first book in the series, and the fictitious book within that book, authored by the frustrated Fenoglio, now trapped within the book, er, within the book. Fenoglio, perhaps not surprisingly, self-referentially wishes in <i>Inkspell</i> that he had written a sequel to <i>Inkheart</i>.) <i>Inkspell</i> should serve as a special treat for fans of the first book, as characters from <i>Inkheart</i> who have found themselves in the "real world" (if there is such a thing) find themselves read back into their own mythic, word-spun world--along with some of our favorite "real-world" characters. As with the previous book, Funke's greatest accomplishment here is telling such a rich and involving (and fun!) story, while still managing sweet, subtle commentary on the nature of words and meaning. Expect a tantalizing finale, too--as Funke says, "No reader will forgive me the ending, though, without a part three." <i>(Ages 8 and up) --Paul Hughes</i></p>Cornelia Funke is a critically acclaimed, award-winning, international best-selling author.

They are gold miners and counterfeiters, attorneys and slaves. They cross other borders too: those of race, law, sex, and sanity. They travel for love or money, incognito or under duress. <br><br>With rich historical detail, the celebrated author of <i>Room</i> takes us from puritan Massachusetts to revolutionary New Jersey, antebellum Louisiana to the Toronto highway, lighting up four centuries of wanderings that have profound echoes in the present. <em>Astray</em> offers us a surprising and moving history for restless times.</p><p>Born in Dublin in 1969, Emma Donoghue is an Irish emigrant twice over: she spent eight years in Cambridge, England, doing a PhD in eighteenth-century literature before moving to London, Ontario, where she lives with her partner and their two children. She also migrates between genres, writing literary history, biography, and stage and radio plays, as well as fairy tales and short stories. She is best known for her novels, which range from the historical (<i>Slammerkin</i>, <i>Life Mask</i>, <i>The Sealed Letter</i>) to the contemporary (<i>Stir-Fry</i>, <i>Hood</i>, <i>Landing</i>). Her international bestseller <i>Room</i> was a <i>New York Times </i>Best Book of 2010 and a finalist for the Man Booker, Commonwealth, and Orange Prizes. "The Hunt" (from <em>Astray</em>) has been short-listed for the <em>Sunday Times </em>EFG Private Bank Short Story Award, the world's most valuable short story prize."Time and again, Emma Donoghue writes books that are unlike anything I have ever seen before, and ASTRAY is no exception.

And, yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable, but that doesn't change the truth that I am worthy of love and belonging."</p><p></p><p>"This important book is about the lifelong journey from 'What will people think?' to 'I am enough.'

But when the same truth keeps repeating itself, it&#x2019;s hard to pretend that it&#x2019;s just a coincidence. For example, no matter how hard I try to convince myself that I can function on six hours of sleep, anything less than eight hours leaves me impatient, anxious, and foraging for carbohydrates. It&#x2019;s a pattern.I also have a terrible procrastination pattern: I always put off writing by reorganizing my entire house and spending way too much time and money buying office supplies and organizing systems. Every single time.<br><br>One reason it&#x2019;s impossible to un-see trends is that our minds are engineered to seek out patterns and to assign meaning to them. Humans are a meaning-making species. And, for better or worse, my mind is actually fine-tuned to do this. I spent years training for it, and now it&#x2019;s how I make my living.<br><br>As a researcher, I observe human behavior so I can identify and name the subtle connections, relationships, and patterns that help us make meaning of our thoughts, behaviors, and feelings. I love what I do. Pattern hunting is wonderful work and, in fact, throughout my career, my attempts at un-seeing were strictly reserved for my personal life and those humbling vulnerabilities that I loved to deny. That all changed in November 2006, when the research that fills these pages smacked me upside the head. For the first time in my career, I was desperate to un-see my own research.<br><br>Up until that point, I had dedicated my career to studying difficult emotions like shame, fear, and vulnerability. I had written academic pieces on shame, developed a shame-resilience curriculum for mental health and addictions professionals, and written a book about shame resilience called <i>I Thought It Was Just Me.</i><br><br>In the process of collecting thousands of stories from diverse men and women who lived all over the country--ranging in age from eighteen to eighty-seven--I saw new patterns that I wanted to know more about. Yes, we all struggle with shame and the fear of not being enough. And, yes, many of us are afraid to let our true selves be seen and known. But in this huge mound of data there was also story after story of men and women who were living these amazing and inspiring lives.<br><br>I heard stories about the power of embracing imperfection and vulnerability. I learned about the inextricable connection between joy and gratitude, and how things that I take for granted, like rest and play, are as vital to our health as nutrition and exercise. These research participants trusted themselves, and they talked about authenticity and love and belonging in a way that was completely new to me.<br><br>I wanted to look at these stories as a whole, so I grabbed a file and a Sharpie and wrote the first word that came to my mind on the tab: <i>Wholehearted.</i> I wasn&#x2019;t sure what it meant yet, but I knew that these stories were about people living and loving with their whole hearts. I had a lot of questions about Wholeheartedness. What did these folks value? How did they create all of this resilience in their lives? What were their main concerns and how did they resolve or address them? Can anyone create a Wholehearted life? What does it take to cultivate what we need? What gets in the way?<br><br>As I started analyzing the stories and looking for re-occurring themes, I realized that the patterns generally fell into one of two columns; for simplicity sake, I first labeled these <i>Do</i> and <i>Don&#x2019;t</i>. The <i>Do</i> column was brimming with words like worthiness, rest, play, trust, faith, intuition, hope, authenticity, love, belonging, joy, gratitude, and creativity. The <i>Don&#x2019;t</i> column was dripping with words like perfection, numbing, certainty, exhaustion, self-sufficiency, being cool, fitting in, judgment, and scarcity.<br><br>I gasped the first time I stepped back from the poster paper and took it all in. It was the worst kind of sticker shock. I remember mumbling, No. No. No. How can this be?&#x201d;<br><br>Even though I wrote the lists, I was shocked to read them. When I code data, I go into deep researcher mode. My only focus is on accurately capturing what I heard in the stories. I don&#x2019;t think about how I would say something, only how the research participants said it. I don&#x2019;t think about what an experience would mean to me, only what it meant to the person who told me about it.<br><br>I sat in the red chair at my breakfast room table and stared at these two lists for a very long time. My eyes wandered up and down and across. I remember at one point I was actually sitting there with tears in my eyes and with my hand across my mouth, like someone had just delivered bad news.<br><br>And, in fact, it was bad news. I thought I&#x2019;d find that Wholehearted people were just like me and doing all of the same things I was doing: working hard, following the rules, doing it until I got it right, always trying to know myself better, raising my kids exactly by the books...After studying tough topics like shame for a decade, I truly believed that I deserved confirmation that I was living right.&#x201d; But here&#x2019;s the tough lesson that I learned that day (and every day since):<br><br><i>How much we know and understand ourselves is critically important, but there is something that is even more essential to living a Wholehearted life: loving ourselves.</i><br><br>Knowledge is important, but only if we&#x2019;re being kind and gentle with ourselves as we work to discover who we are. Wholeheartedness is as much about embracing our tenderness and vulnerability as it is about developing knowledge and claiming power.<br><br>And perhaps the most painful lesson of that day hit me so hard that it took my breath away: It was clear from the data that we cannot give our children what we don&#x2019;t have. Where we are on our journey of living and loving with our whole hearts is a much stronger indicator of parenting success than anything we can learn from how-to books.<br><br>This journey is equal parts heart work and head work, and as I sat there on that dreary November day, it was clear to me that I was lacking in my own heart work.<br><br>I finally stood up, grabbed my marker off the table, drew a line under the <i>Don&#x2019;t</i> list, and then wrote the word<i> me</i> under the line. My struggles seemed to be perfectly characterized by the sum total of the list. I folded my arms tightly across my chest, sunk deep down into my chair, and thought, This is just great. I&#x2019;m living straight down the shit list.<br><br>I walked around the house for about twenty minutes trying to un-see and undo everything that had just unfolded, but I couldn&#x2019;t make the words go away. I couldn&#x2019;t go back, so I did the next best thing: I folded all of the poster sheets into neat squares and tucked them into a Rubbermaid tub that fit nicely under my bed, next to my Christmas wrap. I wouldn&#x2019;t open that tub again until March of 2008.<br><br>Next, I got myself a really good therapist and began a year of serious soul work that would forever change my life. Diana, my therapist, and I still laugh about my first visit. Diana, who is a therapist to many therapists, started with the requisite, So what&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; I pulled out the <i>Do</i> list and matter-of-factly said, I need more of the things on this list. Some specific tips and tools would be helpful. Nothing deep. No childhood crap or anything.&#x201d;<br><br>It was a long year. I lovingly refer to it on my blog as the 2007 [Breakdown] Spiritual Awakening. It felt like a textbook breakdown to me, but Diana called it a spiritual awakening. I think we were both right. In fact, I&#x2019;m starting to question if you can have one without the other. Of course, it&#x2019;s not a coincidence that this unraveling happened in November 2006. The stars were perfectly aligned for a breakdown: I was raw from being newly sugar and flour free, I was days away from my birthday (always a contemplative time for me), I was burned out from work, and I was right on the cusp of my <i>midlife unraveling.</i><br><br>People may call what happens at midlife a crisis,&#x201d; but it&#x2019;s not. It&#x2019;s an unraveling--a time when you feel a desperate pull to live the life you want to live, not the one you&#x2019;re supposed&#x201d; to live. The unraveling is a time when you are challenged by the universe to let go of who you think you are supposed to be and to embrace who you are.<br><br>Midlife is certainly one of the great unraveling journeys, but there are others that happen to us over the course of our lives:<ul><li>marriage </li><li>divorce </li><li>becoming a parent</li><li> recovery</li><li> moving</li><li> an empty nest</li><li> retiring</li><li> experiencing loss or trauma</li><li> working in a soul-sucking job</li></ul>The universe is not short on wake-up calls. We&#x2019;re just quick to hit the snooze button.<br><br>As it turned out, the work I had to do was messy and deep. I slogged through it until one day, exhausted and with mud still wet and dripping off of my traveling shoes, I realized, Oh, my God. I feel different. I feel joyful and real. I&#x2019;m still afraid, but I also feel really brave. Something has changed--I can feel it in my bones.&#x201d;<br><br>I was healthier, more joyful, and more grateful than I had ever felt. I felt calmer and grounded, and significantly less anxious. I had rekindled my creative life, reconnected with my family and friends in a new way, and most important, felt truly comfortable in my own skin for the first time in my life.<br><br>I learned how to worry more about how I felt and less about what people might think.&#x201d; I was setting new boundaries and began to let go of my need to please, perform, and perfect. I started saying no rather than sure (and being resentful and pissed off later). I began to say Oh, hell yes!&#x201d; rather than Sounds fun, but I have lots of work to do&#x201d; or I&#x2019;ll do that when I&#x2019;m _________ (thinner, less busy, better prepared).&#x201d;<br><br>As I worked through my own Wholehearted journey with Diana, I read close to forty books, including every spiritual awakening memoir I could get my hands on. They were incredibly helpful guides, but I still craved a guidebook that could offer inspiration, resources, and basically serve as a soul traveler&#x2019;s companion of sorts.<br><br>One day, as I stared at the tall pile of books precariously stacked on my nightstand, it hit me! <i>I want to tell this story in a memoir.</i> I&#x2019;ll tell the story of how a cynical, smart-ass academic became every bit of the stereotype that she spent her entire adult life ridiculing. I&#x2019;ll fess up about how I became the middle-aged, recovering, health-conscious, creative, touchy-feely spirituality-seeker who spends days contemplating things like grace, love, gratitude, creativity, authenticity, and is happier than I imagined possible. I&#x2019;ll call it <i>Wholehearted.</i><br><br>I also remember thinking, <i>Before I write the memoir, I need to use this research to write a guidebook on Wholehearted living! </i> By mid-2008, I had filled three huge tubs with notebooks, journals, and mounds of data. I had also done countless hours of new research. I had everything I needed, including a passionate desire to write the book that you&#x2019;re holding in your hands.<br><br>On that fateful November day when the list appeared and I sunk into the realization that I wasn&#x2019;t living and loving with my whole heart, I wasn&#x2019;t totally convinced. Seeing the list wasn&#x2019;t enough to fully believe in it. I had to dig very deep and make the <i>conscious choice</i> to believe...to believe in myself and the possibility of living a different life. A lot of questioning, countless tears, and a huge collection of joyful moments later, believing has helped me see.<br></p><h2>The Conjurer&#39;s Riddle (The Inventor&#39;s Secret)</h2><p><b>The Revolution is beginning&#x2013;and Charlotte may be on the wrong side.</b><br><br> In this sequel to <i>The Inventor's Secret</i>, Charlotte and her companions escape the British Empire, but they haven't left danger behind.

More complicated because the unresolved question of slavery&#x2014;the driver of disunion&#x2014;was among the personal legacies that Lee inherited from Washington. More tragic because the Civil War destroyed the people and places connecting Lee to Washington in agonizing and astonishing ways.

Now, Arthus-Bertrand's monumental achievement is available in a revised and expanded edition: Here are all the astonishing original photographs together with 17 new images and authoritative new texts by world-renowned environmentalist Lester Brown and other well-known ecologists-all at the new low price of $45.00! <p>Arthus-Bertrand's remarkable aerial photographs offer the most revealing and spectacular portrait of our world ever created. Produced under the sponsorship of UNESCO, the book is also a unique documentary record of the state of the world's fragile environment.</p></p><p>Ecology, a science scarcely a century old, aims to give its practitioners an approach to understanding how whole natural systems--for example, watersheds, deserts, and estuaries--work. Few books translate this aim as well as <i>Earth from Above</i>, a stunning collection of photographs that affords its viewers a window into the world's workings. It is something of a commonplace, for instance, that the large-scale logging now being visited on the world's rainforests is causing untold damage to tropical ecosystems. In French photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand's hands, this problem is translated from arid fact to alarming image, giving immediate meaning to the statistics that underlie today's environmental headlines; his photographs of the ruins of rural Madagascar, where forests are being cleared at a rate of 1,500 square kilometers (580 square miles) annually, are a sad case in point.<p> Arthus-Bertrand, working with the support of UNESCO, has wandered the globe to gather this collection of more than 200 photographs, presented in a folio format. The images are uniformly striking, whether of stalagmite-like fans of algae spreading into the Mediterranean Sea, farmers working their fields in northern India, or destroyed Iraqi tanks littering the deserts of Kuwait. The accompanying text, captions, and short essays by some of France's leading scientists and social critics lend specific depth to the images, which will cheer few readers--but that will shock, and educate, and, with luck, inspire closer attention to the world around us. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>The result of a five-year airborne odyssey across five continents and 60 countries, Earth from Above is the most revealing and spectacular portrait of our world ever created. From a heart-shaped mangrove forest in New Caledonia to a flock of red ibises in Venezuela, from a caravan of camels in Mauritania to Mt. Everest and Mammoth Hot Springs, re nowned aerial photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand presents nearly 200 striking color images that put our home planet in a whole new perspective. Produced under the sponsorship of UNESCO, the book is also a unique documentary record of the earth&#39;s fragile ecosystems at the dawn of the new millennium.

She has written for <i>New York </i>magazine, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>Bookforum, The New Yorker,</i>&nbsp;NPR's <i>All Things Considered, </i>and several anthologies. She was a TV critic at <i>Salon</i> for seven years.&nbsp;She lives in Los Angeles with a&nbsp;loud assortment of dependents, most of them nondeductible.Author&#x2019;s Note<br>&nbsp;<br>In the fall of 2012, I pitched an existential advice column to <i>The Awl, </i>a website that publishes smart, original takes on modern culture. At the time, I was a regular contributor to the <i>New</i> <i>York Times Magazine, </i>writing mostly essays about pop culture, and I had a column called the Best-Seller List in <i>Bookforum</i>. I&#x2019;d spent seven years as a TV critic for Salon.com, I&#x2019;d written a cartoon called <i>Filler </i>for Suck.com (the Internet&#x2019;s first daily website!) for five years before that, and I&#x2019;d answered advice letters on my own blog as early as 2001. <br><br>But this was something new. I&#x2019;d never dished up advice to a wider audience. When <i>The Awl</i>&#x2019;s co-founder, Choire Sicha, said yes to my idea, he made it clear that the column could be anything I wanted it to be. But what did I want it to be? Obviously, I had all kinds of outspoken, sometimes unwelcome advice to offer friends, family, and complete strangers alike. I&#x2019;d been handing out unsolicited advice for years. But did I want the column to be funny? Did I want to use the column to rail against the scourge of passivity and avoidance in modern relationships or to address our culture&#x2019;s burdensome fixation on constant self-improvement? Did I want to sneak in some commentary on troubled friendships, Kanye West, weddings, rescue dogs, luxe brands, commitmentphobic men, property ownership, the artist&#x2019;s life, pushy mothers-in-law, or <i>Game of</i> <i>Thrones</i>?<br><br>As it turned out, I wanted to do all of these things, and eventually I did. But when I was sitting down to write my first weekly column, I just felt scared. &#x201c;Who do I think I am, giving other people advice?&#x201d; I thought. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not qualified for this! I don&#x2019;t have it all figured out. What the hell am I doing?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>I&#x2019;ve been asking myself that same question every week for four years now. And when Stella Bugbee, the editorial director for <i>New York </i>magazine&#x2019;s website <i>The Cut, </i>approached me about taking my advice column over to her site, I wondered what she was thinking. Sure, this meant a much larger audience for Ask Polly and more money for me. But did she really know what she was signing on to? &#x201c;You know my column is three thousand words long every week, and half of those words are &#x2018;fuck,&#x2019; right?&#x201d; I asked her. Somehow, this didn&#x2019;t scare her off. <br><br>I don&#x2019;t always feel qualified to guide other people to a better life. As a writer, even when I&#x2019;m sitting down to start a book review or a cultural essay, as I&#x2019;ve done professionally for years now, the blank page mocks me. &#x201c;What could <i>you </i>possibly have to say?&#x201d; it asks. &#x201c;When are you going to give this up and do something useful with your life?&#x201d; The blank page can be a real asshole sometimes. <br><br>Still, nothing I do brings me more happiness than writing Ask Polly. I&#x2019;m not always sure of the right answer for any letter, whether someone is dealing with depression and anxiety, a go-nowhere job, a series of not-quite boyfriends, or an overly critical parent. But I do know for certain that when I reach out as far as I can to another person, using my words&#x2014;my awkward, angry, uplifting, uncertain, joyful, clumsy words (half of which are still &#x201c;fuck&#x201d;)&#x2014;some kind of magic happens. There is magic that comes from reaching out. I don&#x2019;t believe in many things, but I believe in that, with all of my heart.</p><h2>Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons: A Novel</h2><p>The women of Freesia Court are convinced that there is nothing good coffee, delectable desserts, and a strong shoulder can&#x2019;t fix.

Calamity, a woman as contrary as the tides around her Caribbean island home, is confronting two of life's biggest dramas. First is the death of her father, who raised her alone until a pregnant Calamity rejected him when she was sixteen years old. The second drama: she's starting menopause. Now when she has a hot flash and feels a tingling in her hands, she knows it's a lost object calling to her.<br><br> Then she finds something unexpected: a four-year-old boy washes up on the shore, his dreadlocked hair matted with shells. Calamity decides to take the orphaned child into her care, which brings unexpected upheaval into her life and further strains her relationship with her adult daughter. Fostering this child will force her to confront all the memories of her own childhood-and the disappearance of her mother so many years before.</p><p>Nalo Hopkinson was born in Jamaica and has lived in Guyana, Trinidad, and Canada.

Life for Calamity has never been easy, and with the death of her father and the onset of menopause, her life becomes crazier than ever. As hot flashes surge, Calamity's childhood ability to find lost items returns. Long-forgotten toys fall from the sky. Her father's old cashew orchard appears in her front yard. And most surprising of all, a seaweed-encrusted and seemingly orphaned child washes up on Calamity's beach. Is Caribbean magic at work? Hammond delivers this enchanting story without a flaw. Her voice, with its soothing low pitch and rhythm, captures island accents and makes listening a pleasure.

The ground rules for this assessment were that only pilot-in-command flights should count, and that marks or variants of a basic type of aircraft were not included. <br> This remarkable record is reflected in the fact that Captain Brown is both the most decorated Fleet Air Arm and British test pilot. The variety of aircraft he has flown is incredible, and though his test and naval flying writings are already internationally known, he now has opened up pages of his Flying Log Books to reveal some of the more unusual types in his unique experience, and to relate their virtues or vices. <br> From the infamous Mitsubishi Zero-Sen and U.S. Navy s piston-engine Grumman F8F-2 Bearcat to the post-war swept-wing de Havilland Swallow. From the North American Savage designed to take off from an aircraft carrier with a nuclear bomb to the Supermarine Attacker, Eric Winkle Brown has tested their qualities and takes the reader into the cockpits of those exciting aircraft to thrill to the joys and hazards of flying both weird and wonderful aircraft with one of the greatest of all pilots.</p><p>"Completely updated with additional information from the original, this one is a keeper and a book that I am positive you will very much enjoy.

In writing it she simultaneously remembers her long and remarkable career, from 1920s Cambridge schoolgirl to Governor of the BBC to best-selling author.</p><p>"At seventy-seven it is time to be in earnest," wrote Samuel Johnson, and bestselling crime writer P.D. James took this maxim as a challenge, setting out to record "one year that otherwise might be lost." The result is a fascinating and reflective account, part diary and part memoir, of one very full year of Baroness James's life, interspersed with her memories and intelligent analysis of "what it was like to be born two years after the end of the First World War and to live for seventy-eight years in this tumultuous century." P.D. James grew up in Cambridge, England, between the wars and worked in the home office of the forensic and criminal justice departments, which sparked her interest in that area, though she did not become a published novelist until 1962 with <i>Cover Her Face</i>. She began to write full-time after her "retirement" in 1979, and along the way became a governor of the BBC before taking a seat in the House of Lords in 1991. <i>Time to Be in Earnest</i> is a lucid and penetrative work by one of the most influential figures currently involved with the arts in Britain. James reveals her vast scope for enjoyment, interest, and simply getting on with life (her husband, Connor White, died at the age of 44 in 1964 after years of mental illness), whether it be spending time with her children and grandchildren, musing on the hideous British architectural mistakes of the 1960s, or giving her view of the controversies continually surrounding the running of the BBC. At an age when many people would be considering slowing down, James seems constantly on the move, recording her day-to-day existence and her past with an alert and judicious eye. "I am sustained by the magnificent irrationality of faith," she states. "I inhabit a different body, but I can reach back over nearly 70 years and recognise her as myself. Then I walked in hope--and I do so still." <i>--Catherine Taylor, Amazon.co.uk</i>"James's fans will eagerly devour every word of this insightful and witty account of a year in the life of the master mystery author."<br>-- <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><p>"Her thoughtful, endearing book is both candid and cagey, agreeably informal and yet tightly controlled...[A] delicately balanced, consistently interesting and finely written account of herself, full of wisdom as well as common sense." <br>-- <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> (London)<br></p><p></p></p><h2>Little Dracula&#39;s Christmas (Little Dracula Series)</h2><p>Little Dracula and his family of vampires celebrate Christmas in their own way and try to capture Santa Claus</p><p></p><h2>Real Justice: A Police Mr. Big Sting Goes Wrong: The Story of Kyle Unger (Lorimer Real Justice)</h2><p><p>On the night of June 23, 1990, teenage friends Kyle Unger and John Beckett made a last-minute decision to attend a music festival near Roseisle, Manitoba. They were loners, not the popular kids at school. But on this night they seemed to finally fit in. They had fun, played games, drank, and hung around bonfires with other people.

Onetti was praised by Latin America's greatest authors, and regarded as an inventor of a new form and school of writing.</b><br><br>Juan Carlos Onetti's <i>A Dream Come True </i>depicts a sharp, coherent, literary voice, encompassing Onetti's early stages of writing and his later texts. They span from a few pages in "Avenida de Mayo - Diagonal - Avenida de Mayo" to short novellas, like the celebrated detective story "The Face of Disgrace" and "Death and the Girl," an existential masterpiece that explores the complexity of violence and murder in the mythical town of Santa Mar�a. His stories create a world of writing which is both universal and highly local, mediating between philosophical characters and the quotidian melodrama of Uruguayan villages.</p><p>Juan Carlos Onetti was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, but began writing in Buenos Aires in the late 1930s. He published short stories in <i>La Naci�n</i> and in the magazine <i>Sur</i>, founded by Victoria Ocampo and Jorge Luis Borges. He then proceeded to write novels centered around the imaginary town of Santa Mar�a, which he described through complex, poetic, and existentialist prose in "Los Astilleros," "Juntacad�veres," and "La vida breve." Due to Argentina's military dictatorship, he was exiled to Spain in 1976, where he worked as a writer for <i>El Pa�s </i>and several Latin American newspapers. His lyrical stories and compact novels awarded him the Cervantes Prize in 1980 and the Rod� Prize in 1991. <b>About the translator:</b> Katherine Silver has translated more than thirty books, mostly of literature from the Americas. Her translations include works by Mar�a Sonia Cristoff, Julio Ram�n Ribeyro, Julio Cort�zar, Daniel Sada, Horacio Castellanos Moya, C�sar Aira, and Pedro Lemebel. She has received numerous awards and prizes, including three National Endowment of the Arts translation fellowships. She was recently translator-in-residence at the University of Iowa, and is the former director of the Banff International Literary Translation Centre."In his quest to explore modern forms of being, Onetti also broke new formal ground. His books are complex ... reality itself devolves into a game of telephone ... [Onetti] writes violent, direct tales filled with intrigue and doom in the best manner of Conrad (the writer he most resembles) and even Faulkner (his great hero)." &#x2014; <b><i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br>"(Onetti's) works, like traditional mystery stories, are structured around a chain of clues, but the deductive method the detective uses to expose the criminal and motive here attempts to penetrate the characters&#x2019; inner torments, which collapse endlessly, one into the other, like a series of trap doors ... by 1940, with 'A Dream Come True,' (Onetti) had written a masterpiece." &#x2014; <b><i>Washington Examiner</i></b><br><br>"Onetti himself seems influenced by Poe by way of Baudelaire&#x2014;but then filtered through William Burroughs, or perhaps B. Traven. The inhabitants of his imagined Santa Mar�a, a port city much like his native Montevideo, are a strange bunch, many of them German and Italian immigrants who are nowhere at home ... Onetti's stories are enigmatic and elegant ... All are strange&#x2014;and mesmerizing. A welcome, overdue collection by a writer well deserving of his place in the Latin American canon." <b>&#x2014; <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (Starred Review)</b><br><br>"In this standout collection, the Uruguayan Onetti, who died in 1994, masterly depicts the seedy disillusionment of characters in a South American backwater . . . There is a hint of Conrad in these misty tales that plunge beyond 'bare facts' and conjure up a world suffused with misanthropy and meditative irony. Readers will be bewitched." <i><b>&#x2014; Publishers Weekly&nbsp;</b></i><b><b>(Starred Review)</b></b><br><br>"Time and circumstance, and the particular bend of prevailing literary history, have all but buried Onetti&#x2019;s fiction in English. And if left unaccounted for, his work&#x2013;to his readers in translation anyway&#x2013;is perhaps in danger of being worn away. Onetti himself once admitted that his reign was not of this world; at the time, he hadn&#x2019;t intended that to be a warning." <b>&#x2014; Jonathan Blitzer, <i>The Nation</i></b><br><br>"Onetti had the strange quality of being inimitable and at the same time creating an entire school of writing. All of his descendants, myself included, received from him a lesson on narrative intelligence, on wise construction, on an immense love to literary imagination, on risk and irony." <b>- Carlos Fuentes </b><br><br>"Onetti is the first modern writer in our language...His world is a dark one, highly pessimistic, with a vision of the human condition that is profoundly desperate, and which we would reject if it didn't reach us with such a wonderful language...I can assure you that, without the great books that I've read, among which I can count Onetti's books, my life would have been infinitely poorer." <b>- Mario Vargas Llosa </b><br><br>"Onetti is an epiphany, a celebration of beauty, of emotion and tenderness." <b>- Antonio Mu��z Molina </b><br><br>"Onetti's writing is so good, a mere sentence by him will give you goosebumps. If I had to sell my soul to the devil in order to write a sentence in Spanish like someone else, I would think about very few authors: Borges, Onetti." <b>- Carlos Gamerro </b><br><br>"Onetti's writing knew that literature is creation, that creation is reality and not repetition or recreation, that it is about finding a good story to tell and then tell it beautifully."<b> - Carlos Liscano</b></p><h2>John Wesley&#39;s Sunday service of the Methodists in North America (Quarterly review reprint series)</h2><p>Facsimile edition of a 1784 copy of John Wesley&#39;s &#34;Sunday Service.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Complete &#34;Omaha&#34; the Cat Dancer: Volume 3</h2><p>In the latest volume of the acclaimed adults-only graphic novel, Chuck struggles to go on without Omaha, while the beautiful cat dancer struts her stuff in a small Wisconsin town and the voluptuous CeeCee enters her life.

The concept of self-love is luminously proclaimed in an interview with Brenda Tapia, a minister and the director of the Love of Learning Program at Davidson College, while the book's second section celebrates familial love. Other sections praise romantic love, the value of love in the community, and love of the land.

He has won both the Nebula and Hugo Awards for his work.Although the promise of Varley's early work has petered out, he retains a remarkable storyteller's voice that supersedes his lack of good stories to tell. The reader is thus drawn into these tales examining the way technology complicates human relationships. From the computer and space flight to future prosthetics, the author asserts, greater options lead both to increased possibilities and to problems. While a few of the selections are affecting, the heavy streak of sentimentality leaves the reader feeling manipulated. Best of the lot are "The Pusher," about one solution to the loneliness of the space traveler; "Tango Charlie and Foxtrot Romeo," featuring a little girl alone on a satellite who has adapted to life with only a computer and a mob of dogs as companions; and the award-winning romantic whodunit "Press Enter."stet <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Emotional Victory: How to deal with how you feel</h2><p>Emotions are a gift from God, but at times they can be misleading.

She has starred in a wide array of movies, and has won eight Grammys and been nominated for two Academy Awards, five Golden Globes, and an Emmy.Parton herself is the first to admit that being asked to speak at a university commencement was one of the most unlikely performances of her career. As a child of poverty from a small town in eastern Tennessee, Parton&#x2019;s formal education ended at high school. That was fine with her, for she had bigger dreams, and the stuff of those dreams is what fueled her career and inspired her remarks to the University of Tennessee graduating class of 2009. Parton&#x2019;s message was simple: dream more, learn more, care more, be more. Realizing that there is, indeed, more to be said about each topic, Parton now expands upon her well-received commencement address, providing examples from her down-and-out childhood as well as her illustrious career as an entertainer, businesswoman, and philanthropist. As unassuming and genuine, vibrant and outrageous as the woman herself, Parton&#x2019;s advice resonates with a sincerity that can be appreciated by graduating students or anyone seeking a comfortable source of inspiration and guidance. --Carol Haggas</p><h2>Classic Cowboy Cartoons (Volume 1)</h2><p>Although J.R.

He&#x2019;s spent a lifetime studying what we don&#x2019;t notice: the hidden cues that determine how much and why people eat. Using ingenious, fun, and sometimes downright fiendishly clever experiments like the &#x201c;bottomless soup bowl,&#x201d; Wansink takes us on a fascinating tour of the secret dynamics behind our dietary habits. How does packaging influence how much we eat? Which movies make us eat faster? How does music or the color of the room influence how much we eat? How can we recognize the &#x201c;hidden persuaders&#x201d; used by restaurants and supermarkets to get us to mindlessly eat? What are the real reasons most diets are doomed to fail? And how can we use the &#x201c;mindless margin&#x201d; to lose&#x2013;instead of gain&#x2013;ten to twenty pounds in the coming year?<br> <br><b>Mindless Eating</b> will change the way you look at food, and it will give you the facts you need to easily make smarter, healthier, more mindful and enjoyable choices at the dinner table, in the supermarket, in restaurants, at the office&#x2013;even at a vending machine&#x2013;wherever you decide to satisfy your appetite.</p><p>Brian Wansink, Ph.D., is an Iowa native and earned his doctorate at Stanford University. He is the John S. Dyson Professor of Marketing and of Nutritional Science at Cornell University, where he is Director of the Cornell Food and Brand Lab. The author of three profesional books on food and consumer behavior, he lives with his family in Ithaca, New York, where he enjoys both French food and French fries each week.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br>The Mindless Margin<br>Did you ever eat the last piece of crusty, dried-out chocolate cake even though it tasted like chocolate-scented cardboard? Ever finish eating a bag of French fries even though they were cold, limp, and soggy? It hurts to answer questions like these.<br><br>Why do we overeat food that doesn&#x2019;t even taste good?<br><br>We overeat because there are signals and cues around us that tell us to eat. It&#x2019;s simply not in our nature to pause after every bite and contemplate whether we&#x2019;re full. As we eat, we unknowingly&#x2013;mindlessly&#x2013;look for signals or cues that we&#x2019;ve had enough. For instance, if there&#x2019;s nothing remaining on the table, that&#x2019;s a cue that it&#x2019;s time to stop. If everyone else has left the table, turned off the lights, and we&#x2019;re sitting alone in the dark, that&#x2019;s another cue. For many of us, as long as there are still a few milk-soaked Fruit Loops left in the bottom of the cereal bowl, there is still work to be done. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if we&#x2019;re full, and it doesn&#x2019;t matter if we don&#x2019;t even really like Fruit Loops. We eat as if it is our mission to finish them.<br>Stale Popcorn and Frail Willpower<br>Take movie popcorn, for instance. There is no &#x201c;right&#x201d; amount of popcorn to eat during a movie. There are no rules of thumb or FDA guidelines. People eat however much they want depending on how hungry they are and how good it tastes. At least that&#x2019;s what they say.<br><br>My graduate students and I think different. We think that the cues around us&#x2013;like the size of a popcorn bucket&#x2013;can provide subtle but powerful suggestions about how much one should eat. These cues can short-circuit a person&#x2019;s hunger and taste signals, leading them to eat even if they&#x2019;re not hungry and even if the food doesn&#x2019;t taste very good.<br><br>If you were living in Chicago a few years back, you might have been our guest at a suburban theater matinee. If you lined up to see the 1:05 p.m. Saturday showing of Mel Gibson&#x2019;s new action movie, <i>Payback</i>, you would have had a surprise waiting for you: a free bucket of popcorn.<br><br>Every person who bought a ticket&#x2013;even though many of them had just eaten lunch&#x2013;was given a soft drink and either a medium-size bucket of popcorn or a large-size, bigger-than-your-head bucket. They were told that the popcorn and soft drinks were free and that we hoped they would be willing to answer a few concession stand-related questions after the movie.<br><br>There was only one catch. This wasn&#x2019;t fresh popcorn. Unknown to the moviegoers and even to my graduate students, this popcorn had been popped five days earlier and stored in sterile conditions until it was stale enough to squeak when it was eaten.<br><br>To make sure it was kept separate from the rest of the theater popcorn, it was transported to the theater in bright yellow garbage bags&#x2013;the color yellow that screams &#x201c;Biohazard.&#x201d; The popcorn was safe to eat, but it was stale enough one moviegoer said it was like eating Styrofoam packing peanuts. Two others, forgetting they had been given it for free, asked for their money back. During the movie, people would eat a couple bites, put the bucket down, pick it up again a few minutes later and have a couple more bites, put it back down, and continue. It might not have been good enough to eat all at once, but they couldn&#x2019;t leave it alone.<br><br>Both popcorn containers&#x2013;medium and large&#x2013;had been selected to be big enough that nobody could finish all the popcorn. And each person was given his or her own individual bucket so there would be no sharing.<br><br>As soon as the movie ended and the credits began to roll, we asked everyone to take their popcorn with them. We gave them a half-page survey (on bright biohazard-yellow paper) that asked whether they agreed to statements like &#x201c;I ate too much popcorn,&#x201d; by circling a number from 1 (strongly disagree) to 9 (strongly agree). As they did this, we weighed their remaining popcorn.<br><br>When the people who had been given the large buckets handed their leftover popcorn to us, we said, &#x201c;Some people tonight were given medium-size buckets of popcorn, and others, like yourself, were given these large-size buckets. We have found that the average person who is given a large-size container eats more than if they are given a medium-size container. Do you think you ate more because you had the large size?&#x201d; Most disagreed. Many smugly said, &#x201c;That wouldn&#x2019;t happen to me,&#x201d; &#x201c;Things like that don&#x2019;t trick me,&#x201d; or &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty good at knowing when I&#x2019;m full.&#x201d;<br><br>That may be what they believed, but it is not what happened.<br><br>Weighing the buckets told us that the big-bucket group people ate an average of 173 more calories of popcorn. That is roughly the equivalent of 21 more dips into the bucket. Clearly the quality of food is not what led them to eat. Once these moviegoers started in on their bucket, the taste of the popcorn didn&#x2019;t matter. Even though some of them had just had lunch, people who were given the big buckets ate an average of 53 percent more than those given medium-size buckets. Give them a lot, and they eat a lot.<br><br><i>And this was five-day-old, stale popcorn</i>!<br><br>We&#x2019;ve run other popcorn studies, and the results were always the same, however we tweaked the details. It didn&#x2019;t matter if our moviegoers were in Pennsylvania, Illinois, or Iowa, and it didn&#x2019;t matter what kind of movie was showing, all of our popcorn studies led to the same conclusion. People eat more when you give them a bigger container. Period. It doesn&#x2019;t matter whether the popcorn is fresh or fourteen days old, or whether they were hungry or full when they sat down for the movie.<br><br>Did people eat because they liked the popcorn? No. Did they eat because they were hungry? No. They ate because of all the cues around them&#x2013;not only the size of the popcorn bucket, but also other factors I&#x2019;ll discuss later, such as the distracting movie, the sound of people eating popcorn around them, and the eating scripts we take to movie theaters with us. All of these were cues that signaled it was okay to keep on eating and eating.<br><br>Does this mean we can avoid mindless eating simply by replacing large bowls with smaller bowls? That&#x2019;s one piece of the puzzle, but there are a lot more cues that can be engineered out of our lives. As you will see, these hidden persuaders can even take the form of a tasty description on a menu or a classy name on a wine bottle. Simply<i> thinking</i> that a meal will taste good can lead you to eat more. You won&#x2019;t even know it happened.<br>As Fine as North Dakota Wine<br><br>The restaurant is open only 24 nights a year and serves an inclusive prix-fixe theme dinner each night. A nice meal will cost you less than $25, but to get it you will have to phone for reservations and be seated at either 5:30 or 7:00 sharp. Despite these drawbacks, there is often a waiting list.<br><br>Welcome to the Spice Box. The Spice Box looks like a restaurant; it sounds like a restaurant; and it smells like a restaurant. To the people eating there, it <i>is</i> a restaurant. To the people working there, it&#x2019;s a fine dining lab sponsored by the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The Spice Box is a lab where culinary hopefuls learn whether a new recipe will fly or go down in flames. It&#x2019;s a lab where waitstaff discover whether a new approach will sizzle or fizzle. It&#x2019;s also a lab where consumer psychologists have figured out what makes a person nibble a little or inhale it all.<br><br>There is a secret and imaginary line down the middle of the dining room in the Spice Box. On one Thursday, diners on the left side of the room might be getting a different version of the shrimp coconut jambalaya entr�e than those on the right. On the next Thursday, diners on the left side will be given a menu with basic English names for the food, while those on the right will be given a menu with French-sounding names. On the Thursday after that, diners on the left side will hear each entr�e described by a waiter, while those on the right will read the same descriptions off the menu. At the end of the meal, sometimes we ask the diners some short survey questions, but other times we carefully weigh how much food our guests have left on their plates. That way we don&#x2019;t have to rely on what they say, we can rely on what they do&#x2013;which version of shrimp coconut jamba- laya they polished off.<br><br>But on one dark Thursday night in the first week of February 2004, something a little more mischievous was planned for diners who braved the snow to keep their reservations. They were getting a full glass of Cabernet Sauvignon before their meal. Totally free. Compliments of the house.<br><br>This cabernet was not a fine vintage. In fact, it was a $2 bottle sold under the brand name Charles Shaw&#x2013;popularly known as Two Buck Chuck. But our diners didn&#x2019;t know this. In fact, all the Charles Shaw labels had been soaked off the bottles and replaced with professionally designed labels that were 100 percent fake.<br><br>Those on the left side of the room were being offered wine from the fictional Noah&#x2019;s Winery, a new California label. The winery&#x2019;s classic, italicized logo was enveloped by a simple graphic of grapes and vines. Below this, the wine proudly announced that it was &#x201c;NEW from California.&#x201d; After the diners arrived and were seated, the waiter or waitress said, &#x201c;Good evening and welcome to the Spice Box. As you&#x2019;re deciding what you want to eat this evening, we&#x2019;re offering you a complimentary glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. It&#x2019;s from a new California winery called Noah&#x2019;s Winery.&#x201d; Each person was then poured a standard 3.8-ounce glass of wine.<br><br>About an hour later, after they had finis...</p><h2>Titan</h2><p>When Cirrocco Jones, captain of the spaceship Ringmaster, and his crew are captured by Gaea, a planet-sized creature that orbits around Saturn, they find themselves inside a bizarre world inhabited by centaurs, harpies, and constantly shifting environments</p><p><b>John Varley</b> is the author of <i>Slow Apocalypse</i>, the Gaean Trilogy (<i>Titan</i>, <i>Wizard</i>, and <i>Demon</i>), <i>Steel Beach</i>, <i>The Golden Globe</i>, <i>Red Thunder</i>, <i>Mammoth</i>, <i>Red Lightning</i>, and <i>Rolling Thunder</i>.

I kept seeing the letter D, Sonya said, and eventually his name came to me: Daniel. Sonya didn t know why the man was there or what he wanted, until she heard that human bones had been found in the coffee shop next door during a renovation project and that the owner of the shop had discarded them. I could not understand why the owner would not have notified the police about finding the bones, but Sonya didn t have an answer for that. All I can say is that you never desecrate human remains. It s a bad thing to doreally bad juju, Sonya said as we talked on the phone. <br>I had been to the Main Street Cafe only a few weeks before, but was unable to meet with Sonya at that time. The building that houses the restaurant is 120 years old. Behind the purple and blue facade and the frosted glass windows, the decor inside recreates that old-time feel with high ceilings, ceiling fans, and wood floors. A handsome old bar and cozy lounge are at the rear of the main dining room. Halfway across the room is a staircase that leads to the basement dining room. It is in the basement where most of the ghostly activity took place. <br>The basement was brick-walled with a low ceiling, the beams exposed. The lighting was dim, provided by only a few small lamps scattered throughout the room and a couple of spotlights. Half a dozen or so tables draped in white tablecloths awaited guests. A bar stood at one end of the room. At the opposite end was a large mural depicting a bearded old man dressed in eighteenth-century style breeches and shirt, sprawled on his back, eyes closed, an empty wineglass in his hand. Floating in the distance was a vineyard. In the foreground, floating above him, were two naked women sprawled on clouds, one facing the viewer, the other providing a delectable rear view. The mural carried a mixed message, both erotic and pathetic at the same time. I was alone in the basement. It was cooler down there than it was upstairs, but that was to be expected in a subterranean setting. No rush of wind. No exploding light bulbs. I glanced over at the stairs where Sonya had sensed the spirit of Daniel, but I m not psychic and didn t feel anything. I took a few pictures then went back upstairs. <br>One of the waitresses told me about another waitress who had set the tables downstairs, lit all the candles, then left the room. When she came back only a few minutes later, every place settingevery knife, fork, and spoonhad been turned upside down. <br>Now, three weeks later, Sonya was telling me that things were much worse than that. Daniel was acting up. He seemed to be attaching himself to Frank, the dishwasher, in particular, Sonya said. Frank used to wear this old Marine compass on a chain around his neck. One day, it suddenly shattered into pieces. He had worn it for years and had never had any problem. Then light bulbs started exploding and Frank cut his hand when he went to change one of them. He was becoming so annoyed by the ghost that at one point, he said he would like to send it back to hell. No sooner had he said that than he fell down the basement stairs, injuring his neck and shoulder. <br>Sonya brought in two friends to help her get rid of Daniel. One was a psychic investigator, the other, a healer. They set up a video camera and tape recorder. While they did not record any images, they did record an evp, an electronic voice phenomenon. There was nothing but silence on the tape. Then, clear as a bell, a man s voice said, Go away. I knew then that Daniel would not go easily, Sonya said. <br>Sonya continued her research and put together a plausible story for the spirit of Daniel. She said he came from Cleveland and was only in his twenties when he died, sometime around<br>1830. She doesn t know how he died, but she is sure he did not receive a proper burial. She believes the bones discovered in the wall next door belonged to Daniel and that his haunting is a result of the desecration exacted upon his final resting place. I wondered if there might not be another explanation for the ghost. Sonya s research revealed that at one point, the building was home to Longacre &amp; Son Furniture. In days gone by, furniture makers frequently doubled as coffin makers, since they had the tools, materials, and skills to do the job. During a winter cholera epidemic that hit Medina in the mid-nineteenth century, victims<br>were stored in coffins in the building until warmer weather made the ground softer for burial. Couldn t one of those poor unfortunates have been the ghost? Could it be that Daniel himself was a cholera victim? <br>Sonya said that she was interested in knowing the ghost s history only to the point that it would help her get rid of it. I don t care what its story is, she said. It s leaving. She said that ghosts simply do not belong here, and that people who try to live with ghosts are doing both themselves and the spirits a disservice. Ghosts are earthbound spirits. They are trapped here when, in fact, they need to move on. They re not healthy to have around, period. They have to go. Some of them don t even know they re dead, but once they understand that, they will move on. Others, like Daniel, are more stubborn and don t want to go, she said. <br>Sonja was concerned about the dishwasher, Frank. His coworkers were telling her that his personality was changing. He was becoming depressed, sometimes surly and angry. Sonja<br>feared that Daniel was taking over. With her two friends, Sonja conducted a healing ceremony at the restaurant, which was recorded by a reporter and photographer from a local newspaper. Sonja didn t give me the details, but did say that her team was able to free Frank from the ghost s influence. After the ceremony, Sonja, the healer, and the photographer went out into the alley near the wall where the bones had been found. There, she knelt in the snow, said the prayers of a Christian burial service, and gave Daniel the rites that had been denied him so long ago. She looked up and saw a huge, bright cloud above the photographer s head.<br> It was the angels, come to take Daniel away, she said. He didn t want to go. I saw him kicking and screaming as the angels dragged him away. <br>It has been quiet at the Main Street Cafe since that incident, but are the ghosts really gone? What about all those cholera victims? Are they still around? And what about that shining white orb I discovered I had captured on film, hovering by the basement stairs? What was that? Only time will tell.<br>"John Kachuba is the author of How to Write Funny and the co-author, with his wife, Mary A. Newman, Ph.D, of Why is This Job Killing Me?

In chapters on the Hull and Seagoing Performance, Armour, Armament, and Machinery, the author outlines the essential compromises and conflicting requirements facing battleship designers. Most navies had good security reasons for withholding correct details of their ships but with the simple rules expounded in this book the reader will be able to identify misleading data in published figures, and to understand the emphasis - on speed, protection or fire-power - in any design. All examples quoted are drawn from real ships, and in passing the author reveals many little-known facts about the world&#39;s battleships, such as why the first German dreadnoughts nearly capsized, the real armour details for the Iowas, and the reasons for the King George Vs&#39; 14 inch guns. Over 250 illustrations - photos, plans and diagrams - and complete accurate tabular data on all significant battleship classes complete a book that is required reading for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the most impressive warships in history.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Magician of the Modern: Chick Austin and the Transformation of the Arts in America</h2><p>The story of Chick Austin is the story, in Virgil Thomson's words, of "a whole cultural movement in one man." Becoming director of Hartford's Wadsworth Atheneum at the age of twenty-six, Austin immediately set about to introduce modern art to America and to transform this conservative insurance capital into a cultural mecca that would become the talk of the art world during the yeasty years between the two world wars.<br><br>The first in the United States to mount a major Picasso retrospective, Austin was soon acquiring works by Dal�, Mondrian, Mir�, Balthus, Max Ernst, and Alexander Calder. In the museum's new theater (which he designed), he staged the premiere of the revolutionary Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thomson opera <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> (with an all-black cast). At Lincoln Kirstein's instigation, he brought Balanchine to America. And he embraced all the new art forms, making film, photography, architecture, and contemporary music part of the life of his museum. For his own family he built a Palladian villa (now a recently restored national historic landmark), filling it with the baroque and the Bauhaus and inviting all the locals in to see how it felt to be modern.<br><br>Austin's instinct for quality proved infallible. Whether acquiring a matchless Caravaggio or a startling Dal�, he balanced the old masters with the modern. Mounting provocative shows that linked the past to the present, he created dramatic installations--and he threw himself into everything, hanging fabrics, creating backdrops, stitching up costumes. He loved to teach, to paint, to act, to give lavish costume balls, and to dazzle audiences of all ages with his performances as a magician, the Great Osram.<br><br>Brilliant at using his magician's sleight of hand, he could manipulate his conservative trustees to get what he wanted--but only up to a point. One more purchase of an incomprehensible abstract canvas, one outrageous party too many, one more shocking theatrical role, eventually led to a crisis. Never one to be idle for long, Austin left Hartford and took on a new challenge--to make an artistic triumph of the pink-and-white palace in Sarasota, Florida, known as the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, which housed the circus king's moldering but magnificent collection.<br>Here is the colorful life of Chick Austin, and as we relish his audacious career--the risks he took, the successes he enjoyed along with the inevitable setbacks--we understand what a far-reaching influence he had on the way Americans look at and think about art. Not only a brilliant portrait of an extraordinary man, this wonderfully American story gives us a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into the art world as it was then--and in many ways still is today.</p><p>It's hard to pinpoint the exact location of the center of the art world. It has resided most famously at one time in Paris and then New York, with other major cities making claim to the title at different times throughout the years. However fleeting this title may be, it still seems surprising that once upon a time Hartford, Connecticut, a town most known for its insurance companies, served as the unofficial gateway and capital of modern art in America. Beginning in the late 1920s, a young and somewhat rebellious Harvard graduate began a career at Hartford's Wadworth Atheneum that would make waves throughout the country and help shape the American artistic climate for years to come. <i>Magician of the Modern: Chick Austin and the Transformation of the Arts in America</i> is the biography of this creative museum director (and amateur actor) whose energy and romantic visions inspired so many. The story is one of a charmed life full of upper-class indulgences like transatlantic trips, short-lived college suspensions, lavish parties, and country houses. <p> Underneath the shiny surface was a real-life soap opera, from an overbearing mother and distant father to a blissful marriage that very slowly crumbled under the pressures of an ever-changing lifestyle--and through it all Austin remained steadfast in his commitment to art and theater. Not every endeavor was successful: a failed collaboration with arts patron Lincoln Kirstein to bring George Balanchine to Hartford was a crushing blow, and his mounting of a Picasso show brought much neighborly criticism. Yet, whatever the project, Austin was always way ahead of the cultural curve, and in Hartford that meant that much of the community was playing a constant game of catch-up. Austin's life is a complex story of travel, art, family, romance, and an ever important group of friends. <i>--J.P. Cohen</i></p>Eugene R. Gaddis is the William G.

But Hari Kunzru's novel, <i>My Revolutions</i>, feels fresh on every page. Not from the over-the-top pyrotechnics that brought so much attention to his precocious debut, <i>The Impressionist</i>, but from a thorough fictional imagination that gives every scene and every character the rich strangeness of reality. It's a grownup story of a youth lived at the edge (and a life spent in its shadow), which makes an emblematic tale of a generation feel irreducibly individual. <i>--Tom Nissley</i><b>Hari Kunzru</b> is the author of <i>The Impressionist</i>, <i>Transmission</i>, and the short story collection <i>Noise</i>.

The egalitarian myth of a classless society was proffered as the unquestionable path down which mankind must travel to reach perfect social harmony. This book does much to shatter these myths and provide a Catholic approach to the way society should be structured as seen by the Popes.</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Preferential option for the nobility. </i>At first glance this expression may startle readers familiar with the more common phrase often used Pope John Paul II: "preferential option for the poor." Nevertheless, what inspires this book is precisely a preferential option for the nobility.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; The objection may be raised that, <i>ex natura rerum</i>, at least a noble is wealthy, well-connected, and socially prominent. Accordingly, he possesses manifold means to deliver himself from any situation of penury into which he may fall. The preferential option already exercised on his behalf by Providence gives him everything he would need to rise again.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; The case of a poor man is precisely the opposite. He has no social standing and no useful connections, and he often lacks the means to remedy his privations. Therefore, a preferential option to help him take care of his basic necessities may be mandated by justice.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; In this light, a preferential option for the nobility seems almost an affront to the poor.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; In reality, however, the antithesis between the nobility and the poor is becoming an anachronism, since poverty besets an ever larger number of nobles, as Pope Pius XII observes in his allocutions to the Roman Patriciate and Nobility. Moreover, the situation of an impoverished noble is more poignant than that of a poor man in the street.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; The poor man, by his very wretchedness, can and should awaken his neighbor's sense of justice as well as his generosity. The nobleman, on the other hand, by virtue of his nobility, has reasons to avoid requesting aid. He even prefers to conceal his name and origins when he can no longer conceal his poverty. This is what the expressive language of old termed "nobility in embarrassed circumstances."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; Efforts to relieve the distress of such nobles--and of all impoverished people regardless of their social status--merited the encomium of the ancients. Christian charity discovered a thousand ingenious ways to alleviate the plight of impoverished nobles without compromising their dignity.[1]<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; However, the materially destitute are not alone in deserving a preferential option. Such an option should also benefit people in positions that entail particularly arduous duties whose fulfillment edifies the social body and whose neglect scandalizes it. Members of the contemporary nobility are often in this category, as the present work will show.[2]<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; The preferential option for the nobility and the preferential option for the poor are by no means mutually exclusive. Nor are they in opposition to one another. Pope John Paul II reminds us: "Yes, the Church takes upon herself the preferential option for the poor. It is, to be sure, an option of preference and not, therefore, an exclusive or excluding option, since the message of salvation is destined for all."[3]<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, these options are complementary ways of manifesting the justice and charity that go hand in hand in the service of the same Lord Jesus Christ, Who is the model both for the nobles and the poor, as the Roman Pontiffs emphatically proclaim.[4]<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; May these words serve as clarification for those who, motivated by the spirit of class struggle--at present in evident decline--cling to the discarded notion that constant conflict between the nobility and the poor is inevitable. This false concept led many to interpret the <i>preferential option</i> of John Paul II as an <i>exclusive</i> preference. Such a passionate and factional interpretation lacks all objectivity. One's preferences may fall simultaneously on several objects with differing degrees of intensity. A preference for one in no sense demands the exclusion of the others.<br> &nbsp;<br> [1] See Documents III.<br> [2] See Chapter I, 1 and 3; Chapter II, 1; Chapter IV, 9 and 10; and Chapter VII, 8.<br> [3] "<em>Ad Patres Cardinales et Curiae Pontificalisque Domus Prelatos, imminente Nativate Domini coram admissos,</em>" December 21, 1984, <i>Acta Apostolicae Sedis</i> (Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis, 1985), Vol. 77, no. 5, p. 511.<br> [4] See Chapter IV, 8; Chapter V, 6; and Documents IV.<i>Nobility and Analogous Traditional Elites in the Allocutions of Pius XII</i>, by the illustrious Brazilian philosopher and author Prof. Plinio Corr�a de Oliveira, is being published simultaneously in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.<br> Many people, influenced by the worn-out egalitarian ideas of the French Revolution, view the nobility as a meaningless, even if beautiful, remnant of bygone days.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Such was not the perspective of Pope Pius XII. In his powerful and moving addresses to the patricians and nobles of Rome, he describes the nobility's important role in contemporary society. He explains its mission of leadership, which it cannot shirk even when deprived of wealth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Many nations--including ours--proscribe the creation of a titled nobility. Nonetheless, they have traditional, aristocratic elites. These analogous elites are also called to guide society and to assume responsibilities for the common good.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; America's history--past and present--reflects the way these elites meet their responsibilities. When they fail, other "elites" assume the guiding role. the cultural revolution undermining our nation today is a prime example of the destructive paths along which these antithetical elites can lead us.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; To counteract them, we can do no better than apply the principles taught by Pius XII as expounded and illustrated by Prof. Plinio Corr�a de Oliveira with well-marshalled arguments and numerous historical examples in this forceful and seminal work.</p><h2>The Double Life Is Twice as Good: Essays and Fiction</h2><p><b>Wildly original novelist, essayist, and performance artist Jonathan Ames delivers a hilarious, risqu�, and loveable selection of articles, essays, and fiction, including several previously unpublished pieces.</b><br><br>In <i>The Double Life Is Twice as Good</i>, fans will be treated to a deft and charming compilation of Ames&#x2019;s journalism, personal essays, and short fiction.

He&#x2019;s the creator of the HBO� Original Series <i>Bored to Death</i> and has had two amateur boxing matches, fighting as &#x201c;The Herring Wonder.&#x201d;The trouble happened because I was bored. At the time, I was twenty-eight days sober. I was spending my nights playing Internet backgammon. I should have been going to AA meetings, but I wasn't. <p> I had been going to AA meetings for twenty years, ever since college. I like AA meetings. My problem is that I'm a periodic alcoholic, even with going to AA. Every few years, I try drinking again. Or, rather, drinking tries me. It tries me on for size and finds out I don't fit and throws me to the ground. And so I go crawling back to AA. Or at least I should. This last go-round, I was skipping meetings and just staying home and, like I said, playing Internet backgammon. </p><p> I was also reading a lot of crime fiction and private detective fiction, writers like Hammett, Goodis, Chandler, Thompson. The usual suspects, as it were. Since my own life was so dull, I needed the charge that came from their books -- the danger, the violence, the despair. </p><p> So that's all I was doing -- reading and playing backgammon. I can afford such a lifestyle because I'm a writer. I'm not a hugely successful writer, but I'm my own boss. I've written six books -- three novels and three essay collections -- and at the time of the trouble I had roughly six thousand dollars in the bank, which is a lot for me. I also had a few checks for movie work coming in down the road. </p><p> By my economic standards it was a flush time. I had even paid my taxes early, at the end of March -- it was now mid-April -- and I was just trying to stay sober and keep a low profile in my own little life. I wasn't doing any writing, because, well, I didn't have anything to say. </p><p> Overall, I was being pretty reclusive. I only talked to a few people, primarily my parents, who are retired and live in Florida and who call me every day. They're a bit needy, my senior citizen parents, but I don't mind, life is short, so if I can give them a little solace with a daily call, what the hell. My father is eighty-two and my mother is seventy-five. I have to love them now as best I can. And the only other two people I really spoke to were the two close friends I have, one who lives here in New York and the other who's in Los Angeles. I have a lot of acquaintances, but I've never had a lot of friends. </p><p> One night a week, I did leave the apartment to go see this girl. It was nice. I guess you could say that she was a friend, too, but I've never really thought of the women in my life as friends, which must be a flaw. Her name was Marie and we would have dinner, maybe go to a movie, and then we'd get into bed at her place, never my place, and the sex with her was good. But it wasn't anything serious. She was twenty-six and I'm forty-two, and I retired from being serious with women a few years ago. Somebody always got hurt, usually the girl, and I couldn't take it anymore. </p><p> Well, I'll shut up now about all this. It's not my drinking problem or my finances or my dead love life that I want to talk about. I only mention all this as some kind of way to explain why I had too much free time on my hands, because what's really on my mind is this trouble I got into because, as I said, I was bored. Bored with backgammon and bored with reading and bored with being sober and bored with myself and bored with being alive. </p><p> I should make it clear that I wasn't at all bored by the books I was tearing through and loving, but bored by the fact that I wasn't actually doing anything, just reading, though it was, in fact, Hammett and Goodis and Chandler and Thompson who sort of provoked me to take action, and it's when I took action, because of those authors' books, that I blew up my life. </p><p> It was a fantasy, a crazed notion, but I got it into my head that I wanted to play at being a private detective. I wanted to help somebody. I wanted to be brave. I wanted to have an adventure. And it's pathetic, but what did I do? I put an ad on craigslist in the "services" section under "legal." It read as follows: </p><p> <b></b></p><b> Private Detective for Hire </b> <p> </p><blockquote> Reply to: serv-261446940@craigslist.org </blockquote> <p> </p><blockquote> Date: 2007-04-13, 8:31AM EST </blockquote> <p> </p><blockquote> Specializing: Missing Persons, Domestic Issues. I'm not licensed, but maybe I'm someone who can help you. My fee is reasonable. Call 347-555-1042 </blockquote> <p> There were two other private-detective ads on craigslist and they offered all sorts of help -- surveillance, undercover work, background checks, video and still photography, business investigations, missing persons, domestic issues, and two things that I didn't quite grasp -- "skip tracing" and "witness locates." </p><p> I figured the only thing I could help with was trying to find someone or maybe following someone, which would most likely be a "domestic issue" -- an unfaithful spouse or boyfriend or girlfriend. I didn't have any qualms about that, following an unfaithful lover, though in all the private-detective fiction I've read the heroes never do "marriage work," as if it's beneath them, but I thought it would be fun to follow somebody and to do so for the purposes of a real mission. Sometimes, probably because I want everything to be like it is in a book or a movie, I have followed people on the streets of New York, pretending I was a detective or a spy. </p><p> I did try to cover myself legally by writing in my ad that I wasn't licensed. I don't know who does license private detectives, but I figured it was a difficult process and, anyway, I just wanted to put the ad up, mostly as a lark, a playing-out of a dream, like when I would shadow people on the streets. But I really didn't think anybody would actually call me -- I was offering far fewer services than the other private detectives and I was acknowledging in the ad that I wasn't exactly a professional. </p><p> If somebody did call, then I figured after talking to me they would try somebody more reputable, but whatever came of it, even if nobody called, I thought it might be something I could write about, a comedic essay -- "My Failed Attempt at Being a Private Detective." Often during my writing career, mostly for my essays, I've put myself in weird positions and then milked it for humor. This situation would be like the time I tried to go to an orgy but wasn't allowed in. Even when nothing happens, you can sometimes make a good story out of it. </p><p> Anyway, I got a thrill at posting the ad, but it was a short-lived thrill. For the first day, I would go and look at my ad, admiring my own handiwork, laughing to myself, wondering if something might happen, almost as if I checked it out enough times, other people would. But then, after about a day, the thrill wore off. It was one more ridiculous thing in a ridiculous life, and, of course, no one called. </p><p> So I went back to the usual routine -- I started a David Goodis novel, <i>Black Friday</i>, and once again I was spending hours playing backgammon. Then on Thursday, April 19, when I was in the midst of a good game, my cell phone rang around four o'clock in the afternoon. The number had an area code I couldn't immediately place -- 215. I answered the phone and kept on playing. </p><p> "Hello?" I said. </p><p> "I saw your ad," said a girl's voice. </p><p> "What? What ad?" I said. I had forgotten completely about my craigslist posting. It had been six days. </p><p> "Craigslist? Missing persons?" </p><p> "Yes, of course, I'm sorry," I said, quickly rallying, remembering my little experiment. "I was distracted. I'm sorry. And most of my clients are word-of-mouth, so I forgot about my ad on craigslist. How can I help you?" </p><p> Right away, I was trying to sound professional, and the lie about the other clients just came to me naturally. I've always been a good liar. </p><p> "It's about my sister..." she started to say, then hesitated, and I glanced at my laptop, at the game. If I resigned, which is the same thing as losing and at the moment I was ahead, my ranking would go down, and I hate for my ranking to go down. I've worked very hard to get it to the second-highest level. I was momentarily conflicted, but I clicked a button and resigned from the game so that I could give my full attention to this other game, this one with the young-sounding girl on the phone. </p><p> "Your sister?" I said, prompting her. </p><p> "Well, I came in from Philadelphia this morning" -- she started slow and then her speech came fast, real fast, the way young girls talk -- "and we're supposed to go to a show tonight. I know it's weird but we got tickets to <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, we saw it when we were really young and loved it and now it's closing, so that's why we want to see it, but she didn't answer her phone all day yesterday or this morning, but I came in anyway, it was our plan, I figured she's just not picking up or it's not charged, she always forgets to charge her phone, but she's still not answering and now her voice mail is full, and no one at her dorm has seen her for a while and the guard let me in, but she's not in her room, the door is locked, she has a single, and I don't want to call my parents and freak them out, but I have a weird feeling, she's got this sleazy boyfriend, and I don't know what to do, and I'm at this Internet caf� and I always use craigslist for everything, so I typed in 'missing persons' and found you." </p><p> This was a lot to digest. I tried to break it down. </p><p> "Your sister lives in a dorm? Where?" </p><p> "Twelfth Street and Third Avenue. It's an NYU dorm." </p><p> "And where are you?" I asked. </p><p> "This caf�. On Second Avenue. I don't know the cross street, let me look out the window...Third Street." </p><p> "What's your name?" </p><p> "Rachel." </p><p> "Last name?" </p><p> "Weiss." </p><p> "Your sister's name?" </p><p> "Lisa...Weiss." </p><p> "And I'm Jonathan...Spencer, by the way...You can call me Jonathan. And you live in Philadelphia?" The lies were coming fast and easy. Spencer was my strange middle name. I'm Jewish but my parents loaded me up with a WASP assembly of names, Jonathan Spencer Ames. </p><p> "Yeah, I go to Temple," she said. "I'm a freshman." </p><p> "What year is your sister?" </p><p> "Junior." </p><p> "And where are your parents?" </p><p> "Maryland...Can you hel...</p></p><h2>Olaf Wieghorst</h2><p>Western art and biography of Olaf Wieghorst, an outstanding contemporary western artist</p><p></p><h2>At Home in Dogwood Mudhole Volume 1 Nothing That Eats by Franklin Sanders (2012-05-04)</h2><p>When Y2K looms and modern life fails to satisfy, Franklin Sanders and wife Susan go from nuclear family to multigenerational farm.

Their daughter, Philippa Duke Schuyler, became the embodiment of this theory, and they hoped she would prove that interracial children represented the final solution to America's race problems.<br> Able to read and write at the age of two and a half, a pianist at four, and a composer by five, Philippa was often compared to Mozart. During the 1930s and 40s she graced the pages of <em>Time</em> and <em>Look</em> magazines, the <em>New York Herald Tribune</em>, and <em>The New Yorker</em>. Philippa grew up under the adoring and inquisitive eyes of an entire nation and soon became the role model and inspiration for a generation of African-American children. But as an adult she mysteriously dropped out of sight, leaving America to wonder what had happened to the "little Harlem genius." Suffering the double sting of racism and gender bias, Philippa had been rejected by the elite classical music milieu in the United States and forced to find an audience abroad, where she flourished as a world-class performer and composer. She traveled throughout South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia performing for kings, queens, and presidents. By then Philippa had added a second career as an author and foreign correspondent reporting on events around the globe--from Albert Schweitzer's leper colony in Lamber�n� to the turbulent Asian theater of the 1960s. She would give a command performance for Queen Elisabeth of Belgium one day, and hide from the Viet Cong among the ancient graves of the Annam kings another.<br> But behind the scrim of adventure, glamour, and intrigue was an American outcast, a woman constantly searching for home and self. "I am a beauty--but I'm half colored...so I'm always destined to be an outsider," she wrote in her diary. Philippa tried to define herself through love affairs, but found only disappointment and scandal. In a last attempt to reclaim an identity, she began to "pass" as Caucasian. Adopting an Iberian-American heritage, she reinvented herself as Felipa Monterro, an ultra-right conservative who wrote and lectured for the John Birch Society. Her experiment failed, as had her parents' dream of smashing America's racial barriers. But at the age of thirty five, Philippa finally began to embark on a racial catharsis: She was just beginning to find herself when on May 9, 1967, while on an unauthorized mission of mercy, her life was cut short in a helicopter crash over the waters of war-torn Vietnam.<br> The first authorized biography of Philippa Schuyler, <em>Composition in Black and White</em> draws on previously unpublished letters and diaries to reveal an extraordinary and complex personality. Extensive research and personal interviews from around the world make this book not only the definitive chronicle of Schuyler's restless and haunting life, but also a vivid history of the tumultuous times she lived through, from the Great Depression, through the Civil Rights movement, to the Vietnam war. Talalay has created a highly perceptive and provocative portrait of a fascinating woman.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Kathryn Talalay</strong>, the recipient of a 1988-1989 Rockefeller Foundation Grant, was on the faculty of Indiana University for fourteen years. The author of numerous articles and a contributor to the <em>Encyclopedia of African-American Culture and History</em>, she is currently archivist and editor at the American Academy of Arts and Letters in New York City, where she lives with her husband Frank Ponzio, a jazz pianist and composer.<br>Philippa Schuyler led an accomplished, complex, and tragic life. She was the first "colored girl" to achieve national prominence at an early age. Growing up in the 1940s and 1950s was difficult for an African American female who not only was the daughter of an interracial union but also a child prodigy, both intellectually and musically. Her father, George Schuyler, a noted black writer, influenced her thinking and political views. Her mother, Josephine Cogdell, daughter of a white, wealthy Texas family, sacrificed her position to marry the infamous <i>Messenger</i> editor, Schuyler. Philippa's musical career, concertizing and composing, lovers, associates, and friends spanned continents. She exerted an influence on the culture of her time and was a role model for children of that era. Her inspiration transcended music--one woman noted that after attending her performance, she decided to become a writer. In her twenties, Philippa became an author of fiction and nonfiction and a roving reporter spending a great deal of time relating events of the Vietnam War. Her untimely death in 1967 marked the tragic end of Philippa's duality: in her careers, music and journalism, and identity, black <i>or</i> white. <i>Lillian Lewis</i></p><h2>Herod the Great</h2><p>Contents: The Rise of Herod. - Herod's Greater Judea. - Anti-Climax. - Summing Up. - Notes. - Maps. - Chronological Table. - Genealogical Table. - Further Reading. - Index. <br> <br> Illustrated with black-and-white photographs and twelve maps. <br> <br> Michael Grant (1914-2004) was an English classicist, numismatist and author, editor and translator of numerous popular books on ancient history.</p><p></p><h2>Maigret and the Hotel Majestic</h2><p>When the corpse of a guest in a Paris luxury hotel is discovered by the breakfast cook in the basement, Maigret searches for the culprit among the hotel&#39;s employees and patrons</p><p>Georges Simenon (1903-1989) was born in Lie`ge, Belgium.

Many ancient historians were very hostile and Edward Gibbon later dubbed him &#x2018;the common enemy of mankind&#x2019;. Yet his reign was considered by at least one Roman author to be the apogee of the Roman Empire. Guilty of many murders and massacres (including his own brother, ex-wife and daughter) he was, however, popular with the army, improving their pay and cultivating the image of sharing their hardships. Surprisingly this is the first full-length biography of this colorful character in English. <br><br>Ilkka Syvanne explains how the biased ancient sources in combination with the stern looking statues of the emperor have created a distorted image of the man and then reconstructs the actual events, particularly his military campaigns and reforms, to offer a balanced view of his reign. The biography offers the first complete overview of the policies, events and military campaigns of the reign and explains how and why these contributed to the military crisis of the third century.</p><p>Dr Ilkka Syv�nne gained his doctorate in history in 2004 from Tampere University in his native Finland. He was vice chairman of the Finnish Society for Byzantine Studies from 2007 to 2016. In 2016 he was nominated as an Affiliated Professor of the University of Haifa. His previous books include the first three volumes (of seven planned) of The Military History of Late Rome; Caracalla, A Military Biography (2017); and The Reign of Emperor Gallienus 2019 all by Pen &amp; Sword.&#x201c;I cannot praise the book enough. From the illustrations to the diagrams that show how Caracalla tried to emulate the army of Alexander the Great, the information in the book is priceless.&#x201d; (<i>A Wargamers Needful Things</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This is an excellent, thought-provoking look at a much maligned character... it is a critical read for any serious student of the period.&#x201d; (<i>The NYMAS Review, Spring 2018</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Syv�nne does an excellent job of reevaluating the traditional sources, consulting additional materials not necessarily available to past generations of scholars, such as ancient Armenian and Georgian histories, and critically comparing them, covering many critical issues in several appendices.&#x201d; (<i>StrategyPage</i>)</p><h2>Commentary on the Prophecies of Isaiah</h2><p>Joseph Addison Alexander&#39;s &#34;Commentary on the Prophecies of Isaiah&#34; is in a very real sense a classic. This famous expository work first appeared in 1846-1847 to enjoy a wide ministry of usefulness in the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, this eminent study of the prince of Old Testament prophets has lost none of its essential usefulness and appeal to careful Bible students of today. This present reprint is the revised edition of 1875 prepared by the learned Dr. John Eadie of Glasgow , Scotland, who with critical acumen pronounced Alexander&#39;s work as &#34;among the best commentaries on Isaiah of any age or language.&#34; A remarkable linguist commanding a mastery of both Hebrew and Greek, Alexander was eminently qualified as an expositor of the Sacred Text. His comprehensive knowledge of Hebrew makes his work especially useful to students of the original text. But his linguistic abilities were shielded from being narrowly confined to a circumscribed academic sphere by his unusual talent for simplifying and clarifying truth. This latter gift, which unfortunately every great scholar does not possess, gives his work access to a much wider circle of readers. He was a happy combination of a thorough scholar and a skillful popularizer in whom vast learning was mellowed by true evangelical faith and piety. This work, &#34;Commentary on the Prophecies of Isaiah,&#34; is his crowning labour, his imperishable monument.</p><p></p><h2>The Last Snake in Ireland</h2><p>Before he becomes a saint, Patrick drives all the snakes but one out of Ireland and that last one he throws into Scotland&#39;s Loch Ness</p><p>Those pesky Irish snakes! Patrick (pre-sainthood) could ignore their naughty behavior for a while, but when they start teasing his poor old dog Finbar, well, that is just the last straw. It is clearly time to haul out his magic bell and rid the land of this pestilence! But before Patrick can rest too heavily on his laurels, he discovers that the biggest, oldest, sneakiest snake in all of Ireland has resisted his magic and is now bound and determined to make his life miserable. Whenever Patrick's back is turned, the sly serpent steals swigs from his mug of buttermilk, peeks in the window while he is entertaining friends, or hides under his quilt at night. Patrick's attempts to outsmart and outrun his sinuous enemy through all of Ireland and Scotland culminate in a surprising, indeed extraordinary, turn of events. <p> Sheila MacGill-Callahan's lively, lilting version of the well-known story of Saint Patrick (combined cleverly with another familiar tale) is a fantastic introduction to Irish and Scottish legend. Will Hillenbrand's gorgeous mixed-media paintings invite the reader to slither gleefully along on this battle of wills.

Narrowly escaping an arranged marriage, Najin takes up a new role as a companion to a young princess.

After one day of marriage a denied passport separates her from her new husband, who continues alone to America. As a decade passes and the world descends into war, Najin loses touch with her husband. Will the love they share be enough to sustain her through the deprivation her country continues to endure? <i>The Calligrapher's Daughter</i> is a richly drawn novel about a nation torn between ancient customs and modern possibilities, and is a "vivid, heartfelt portrait of faith, love and life for one family during a pivotal time in history" (<i>Bookpage</i>).</p></p><p><p><b>Eugenia Kim</b>, an MFA graduate of Bennington College, has published short stories and essays in journals and anthologies, including <i>Echoes Upon Echoes: New Korean American Writings</i>.

Until that day, I had answered to Baby, Daughter or Child, so for the first five years of my life hadn&#x2019;t known I ought to have a name. Nor did I know that those years had seen more than fifty thousand of my Korean countrymen arrested and hundreds more murdered. My father, frowning as he did when he spoke of the Japanese, said we were merely fodder for a gluttonous assimilation. </p><p>The servants called me <em>Ahsee,</em> Miss, and outside of the family I was politely referred to as my mother&#x2019;s daughter. To address an adult by name was considered unspeakably rude. Instead, one was called by one&#x2019;s family relational position, or profession. My father was the literati-scholar-artist, the calligrapher Han, much respected, and my mother was the scholar&#x2019;s wife. And because my mother wasn&#x2019;t native to Gaeseong, she was also properly called &#x201c;the woman from Nah-jin,&#x201c; a wintry town on the far northeast border near Manchuria. Thus, if a church lady said, &#x201c;That one, the daughter of the woman from Nah-jin,&#x201c; I knew I was in trouble again. </p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t a perfect daughter. Our estate overflowed with places to crawl, creatures to catch and mysteries to explore, and the clean outside air, whether icy, steamy or sublime, made me restive and itching with curiosity. Mother tried to discipline me, to mold my raw traits into behavior befitting <em>yangban,</em> aristocrats. An only child, I was expected to uphold a long tradition of upper-class propriety. There were many rules&#x2014;all seemingly created to still my feet, busy my hands and quiet my tongue. Only much later did I understand that the sweeping change of those years demanded the stringent practice of our rituals and traditions; to venerate their meaning, yes, but also to preserve their existence simply by practicing them. </p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t consistently abide by the rules, though, and often found myself wandering into the forbidden rooms of my father. Too many fascinating things happened on his side of the house to wait for permission to go there! But punishment had been swift the time Myunghee, my nanny, had caught me eavesdropping outside his sitting room. She&#x2019;d switched the back of my thighs with a stout branch and shut me in my room. I cried until I was exhausted from crying, and my mother came and put cool hands on my messy cheeks and cold towels on my burning legs. I now know that she&#x2019;d sat in the next room listening to me cry, as she worked a hand spindle, ruining the thread with her tears. Many years later, my mother told me that the cruelty of that whipping had revealed Myunghee&#x2019;s true character, and she wished she had dismissed her then, given all that came to pass later. </p><p>I didn&#x2019;t often cry that dramatically. Even at the age of five, I worked especially hard to be stoic when Myunghee pinched my inner arms where the bruises wouldn&#x2019;t be easily discovered. It was as if we were in constant battle over some unnamed thing, and the only ammunition I had was to pretend that the hurts she inflicted didn&#x2019;t matter. Hired when I was born, Myunghee was supposed to be both nanny and companion. Her round face had skin as pale and smooth as rice flour, her eyes were languid with what was mistaken for calm, and her narrow mouth was as sharp as the words it uttered. When we were apart from the other servants or out of sight of my mother, Myunghee shooed me away, telling me to find my own amusement. So I spied on her as she meandered through our house. She studied her moon face reflected in shiny spoons, counted silver chopsticks, fondled porcelain bowls and caressed fine fabrics taken from linen chests. At first I thought she was cleaning, but my mother and I cleaned and dusted with Kira, the water girl. Perhaps she meant to launder the linens, but Kira did the laundry and was also teaching me how to wash clothes. Maybe the bowls needed polishing, but Cook was very clear about her responsibilities and would never have asked for help. As I spied on Myunghee, I wondered about her strangeness and resented that she refused to play with me. </p><p>My mother&#x2019;s visit had brought me great relief, but my stinging thighs sparked a long-smoldering defiance and I swore to remain alert for the chance to visit my father&#x2019;s side of the house again. </p><p>And so on this day, when six elders and their wives came to visit, I found my chance after the guests had settled in&#x2014;the women in Mother&#x2019;s sitting room and the men with Father. I crept down Father&#x2019;s hallway, nearing the big folding screen displayed outside his door, and heard murmurings about resisting the Japanese. The folding screen&#x2019;s panels were wide enough for me to slide into a triangle behind an accordion bend. The dark hiding place cooled the guilty disobedience that was making me hot and sweaty, a completely unacceptable state for a proper young lady. I breathed deeply of the dust and dark to calm myself, and cradled my body, trying to squeeze it smaller. Pipe smoke filtered through the door, papers shuffled, and I wondered which voice in the men&#x2019;s dialogue belonged to whom. The papers must have been my father&#x2019;s collection of the <em>Daehan Maeil News</em> I knew he&#x2019;d saved over the past several months. This sole uncensored newspaper, distributed nationwide for almost a full year, had recently been shut down. The men discussed the forced closure of the newspaper, Japan&#x2019;s successes in China and unceasing new ordinances that promoted and legalized racial discrimination. Naturally I understood none of this, but the men&#x2019;s talk was animated, tense and punctuated repeatedly with unfamiliar words. </p><p>I slipped from behind the screen, tiptoed down the hall and, once safely on our side of the house, ran to Mother&#x2019;s room, eager to ask what some of those words meant: <em>Europe, war, torture, conscript, dissident</em> and <em>bleakfuture.</em> </p><p>The men&#x2019;s wives sat around the open windows and door of my mother&#x2019;s sitting room, fanning themselves, patting their hair and fussing about the humidity. I spun to retreat, realizing too late that Mother would be in the kitchen supervising refreshments. A woman with painted curved eyebrows and an arrow-sharp chin called <em>&#x201c;Yah!&#x201d;</em> and beckoned me closer. </p><p>&#x201c;You see?&#x201d; Her skinny hand pecked the air like an indignantly squawking hen. The others turned to look, and I bowed, embarrassed by their attention, sure that my cheeks were as pink as my skirt. Garden dirt clung to my hem, but I managed to refrain from brushing it off and folded my hands dutifully, keeping every part of me still. </p><p>Another woman said, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s pretty enough.&#x201d; I felt their eyes studying me. My hair was braided as usual into two thick plaits that hung below my shoulders. Still plump with childhood, I had gentle cheekbones, round rabbit eyes wide apart, a flat bridge above an agreeable nose, and what I hoped was an intelligent brow, topped with short hairs sprouting from a center part. Unnerved by their stares, involuntarily I grasped a braid and twisted it. </p><p>&#x201c;Still, it&#x2019;s unusual for such a prominent scholar,&#x201c; said the arched-eyebrow woman, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Unusual?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well, yes. Granted, she&#x2019;s a girl,&#x201c; and she turned her head theatrically to hold every eye in the room, &#x201c;but isn&#x2019;t it odd for a man whose lifelong pursuit is art, literature and scholarship&#x2014;the study of words!&#x2014;that such a man would neglect naming his own daughter?&#x201d; </p><p>The ladies chimed in with <em>yah </em>and <em>geulsae </em>and similar sounds of agreement, and the woman waved me away. </p><p>I left for the kitchen, frowning, and though I don&#x2019;t like to admit it, pouting as well. Cook and Kira were helping my mother prepare platters of fancy rice cakes, decoratively sliced plums and cups of cool water. Before reaching the door I heard my mother say, &#x201c;Where is that Myunghee?&#x201d; I stopped to eavesdrop, surprised at her obvious irritation. She regularly cautioned me to never speak crossly to or about the servants. Myunghee was notorious for disappearing when work called, and now had pushed my mother&#x2014;who hardly ever raised her voice&#x2014; into impatience. Remembering my tender thighs, I gloated a little. </p><p>&#x201c;Is that you?&#x201d; Mother said. </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me, <em>Umma-nim.</em>&#x201c; I remembered my quest. &#x201c;They say I don&#x2019;t have&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;See if you can find your nanny. No, wait. Ask the gardener if he found more plums. Hurry.&#x201d; </p><p>Beyond the courtyard, skinny Byungjo peered into a fruit tree with a bamboo pole in hand and a half basket of plums at his feet. He said he&#x2019;d take the fruit to the kitchen, so my task was done. I roamed around to the front yard, and not seeing Myunghee or anyone else nearby, I crawled into a little natural arbor I&#x2019;d found beneath the lilac bushes near the front gate. </p><p>Though I wasn&#x2019;t sure what not being named meant, it was obviously something bad enough to make those snake-mouthed women find fault with me and, alarmingly, with my father. Since I had heard the year of my birth, 1910, mentioned many times by the men, I wondered if my lack of name was linked to their urgent discussion. I wanted even more to know those words, but my mother was the only one I could ask. I hugged my knees and drew stick figures of the elders&#x2019; wives in the dirt. I pretended they were nameless too, an easy game since I called them each Respected Aunt and knew none of their given names. </p><p>The lilac&#x2019;s clotted perfume suffused the enclosed arbor, and my eyes grew heavy. I nodded sleepily and it seemed the vines shivered, scattering purple petals like a shaking wet dog. </p><p>The gate slammed open to Japanese shouts, and uniformed men crashed through the yard. Sunlight refracted from their scabbards and danced on th...</p></p><h2>Victorian Undertaker (Shire Library)</h2><p>The Victorians were, were relatively at ease with death and there is much in this book to interest social historians, those interested in historical costume and transport enthusiasts, as there is a section on the development of the horse-drawn hearse.</p><p></p><h2>The Summer of the Bonepile Monster</h2><p>Hollis and his sister, Lou, must stay at their great-grandmother&#39;s house in rural Alabama over the summer while his mom and dad are working out problems of their own.

In the Godine tradition of publishing books for children that both challenge and delight, this is one edition that just may be more prized by parents, for we have decided to do the collaboration justice by printing it letterpress (with the woodcuts in a very subtle third color). But even if you are not enamored of the dents of metal in paper, you will certainly be seduced by Smith&#39;s marvelous sprung rhythms and catchy cadences, with each poem accompanied by the strong and vibrant woodcuts created by the gentle genius of Jacques Hnizdovsky.</p><p>Some of the 29 poems in this letterpress edition are new, others are shuffled in from Smith's previously published work. The resulting potpourri is so diverse that it seems a collection of various writers rather than a unified assortment in Smith's splendid voice. The poems vary from the nonsensical ("If you should see / A spotted Cow go flying by / Above a pawpaw tree") to the descriptive ("With tail atilt like a violincello, / Comes the Squirrel musically."), but few match the verve and deft humor of Hnizdovsky's crisp black-and-white woodcuts that deftly characterize each animal.

This is the chilling message found in a school&#39;s time capsule, ten years after it was buried. But surely, if a thirteen-year-old wrote it, it can&#39;t be a real threat... Huldar suspects he&#39;s been given the investigation simply to keep him busy and away from real police work. He turns to Freyja to help with the psychology of the child who hid the note. Soon, however, they find themselves at the heart of another shocking case... For the discovery of the letter coincides with a string of macabre events: body parts found in a garden, followed by the murder of the man who owned the house. His initials are BT... and now time is running out to identify the writer, the victims and the killer, before further deaths come.</p><p>Author of the bestselling Thora Gudmundsdottir crime series and several stand-alone thrillers, Yrsa Sigurdardottir was born in Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1963 and works as a civil engineer.

In fact, the door was beyond ordinary, wood and fourpaneled, the kind of door you see standing guard in front of three out of every four suburban homes, with faded paint and a knocker at chest level no one ever used and a faux brass knob.</p><p>But as I walked toward it, a distant streetlight barely illuminating my way, the dark opening yawning like a mouth ready to gobble me whole, the feeling of doom was unshakable. Each step forward took great effort, as if I were walking not along a somewhat crackled walk but through still-wet cement. My body displayed all the classic symptoms of impending menace: Chill down my spine? Check. Hairs standing up on my arms? Yep. Prickle at the base of the neck? Present. Tingle in the scalp? Right there.</p><p>The house was dark, not a single light on. Chynna warned me that would be the case. The dwelling somehow seemed a little too cookie-cutter, a little too nondescript. That bothered me for some reason. This house was also isolated at the tippy end of the cul-de-sac, hunkering down in the darkness as though fending off intruders.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t like it.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t like anything about this, but this is what I do. When Chynna called I had just finished coaching the inner-city fourth-grade Newark Biddy Basketball team. My team, all kids who, like me, were products of foster care (we call ourselves the NoRents, which is short for No Parents&#x2014;gallows humor), had managed to blow a six-point lead with two minutes left. On the court, as in life, the NoRents aren&#x2019;t great under pressure.</p><p>Chynna called as I was gathering my young hoopsters for my postgame pep talk, which usually consisted of giving my charges some life-altering insight like &#x201c;Good effort,&#x201d; &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get them next time,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget we have a game next Thursday,&#x201d; always ending with &#x201c;Hands in&#x201d; and then we yell, &#x201c;Defense,&#x201d; choosing to chant that word, I suppose, because we play none.</p><p>&#x201c;Dan?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who is this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Chynna. Please come.&#x201d;</p><p>Her voice trembled, so I dismissed my team, jumped in my car, and now I was here. I hadn&#x2019;t even had time to shower. The smell of gym sweat mixed now with the smell of fear sweat. I slowed my pace.</p><p>What was wrong with me?</p><p>I probably should have showered, for one thing. I&#x2019;m not good without a shower. Never have been. But Chynna had been adamant. Now, she had begged. Before anyone got home. So here I was, my gray T-shirt darkened with perspiration and clinging to my chest, heading to that door.</p><p>Like most youngsters I work with, Chynna was seriously troubled, and maybe that was what was setting off the warning bells. I hadn&#x2019;t liked her voice on the phone, hadn&#x2019;t really warmed to this whole setup. Taking a deep breath, I glanced behind me. In the distance, I could see some signs of life on this suburban night&#x2014;house lights, a flickering television or maybe computer monitor, an open garage door&#x2014;but in this cul-de-sac, there was nothing, not a sound or movement, just a hush in the dark.</p><p>My cell phone vibrated, nearly making me jump out of my skin. I figured that it was Chynna, but no, it was Jenna, my ex-wife. I hit answer and said, &#x201c;Hey.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can I ask a favor?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a little busy right now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I just need someone to babysit tomorrow night. You can bring Shelly if you want.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shelly and I are, uh, having trouble,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Again? But she&#x2019;s great for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have trouble holding on to great women.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t I know it.&#x201d;</p><p>Jenna, my lovely ex, has been remarried for eight years. Her new husband is a well-respected surgeon named Noel Wheeler. Noel does volunteer work for me at the teen center. I like Noel and he likes me. He has a daughter by a previous marriage, and he and Jenna have a six-year-old girl named Kari. I&#x2019;m Kari&#x2019;s godfather, and both kids call me Uncle Dan. I&#x2019;m the family go-to babysitter.</p><p>I know this all sounds very civilized and Pollyanna, and I suppose it is. In my case, it could be simply a matter of necessity. I have no one else&#x2014;no parents, no siblings&#x2014;ergo, the closest thing I have to family is my ex-wife. The kids I work with, the ones I advocate for and try to help and defend, are my life, and in the end I&#x2019;m not sure I do the slightest bit of good.</p><p>Jenna said, &#x201c;Earth to Dan?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there,&#x201d; I said to her.</p><p>&#x201c;Six thirty. You&#x2019;re the best.&#x201d;</p><p>Jenna made a smooching noise into the mouthpiece and hung up. I looked at the phone for a moment, remembered our own wedding day. It was a mistake for me to get married. It is a mistake for me to get too close to people, and yet I can&#x2019;t help it. Someone cue the violins so I can wax philosophical about how it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. I don&#x2019;t think that applies to me. It is in humans&#x2019; DNA to repeat the same mistakes, even after we know better. So here I am, the poor orphan who scraped his way up to the top of his class at an elite Ivy League school but never really scraped off who he was. Corny, but I want someone in my life. Alas, that is not my destiny. I am a loner who isn&#x2019;t meant to be alone.</p><p><i>&#x201c;We are evolution&#x2019;s garbage, Dan. . . .&#x201d;</i></p><p>My favorite foster &#x201c;dad&#x201d; taught me that. He was a college professor who loved to get into philosophical debates.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Think about it, Dan. Throughout mankind, the strongest and brightest did what? They fought in wars. That only stopped this past century. Before that, we sent our absolute best to fight on the front lines. So who stayed home and reproduced while our finest died on distant battlefields? The lame, the sick, the weak, the crooked, the cowardly&#x2014;in short, the least of us. That&#x2019;s what we are the genetic by-product of, Dan&#x2014;millenniums of weeding out the premium and keeping the flotsam. That&#x2019;s why we are all garbage&#x2014;the dung from centuries of bad breeding.&#x201d;</i></p><p>I forwent the knocker and rapped on the door lightly with my knuckles. The door creaked open a crack. I hadn&#x2019;t realized that it was ajar.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t like that either. A lot I didn&#x2019;t like here.</p><p>As a kid, I watched a lot of horror movies, which was strange because I hated them. I hated things jumping out at me. And I really couldn&#x2019;t stand movie gore. But I would still watch them and revel in the predictably moronic behavior of the heroines, and right now those scenes were replaying in my head, the ones where said moronic heroine knocks on a door and it opens a little and you scream, &#x201c;Run, you scantily clad bimbo!&#x201d; and she wouldn&#x2019;t and you couldn&#x2019;t understand it and two minutes later, the killer would be scooping out her skull and munching on her brain.</p><p>I should go right now.</p><p>In fact, I will. But then I flashed back to Chynna&#x2019;s call, to the words she&#x2019;d said, the trembling in her voice. I sighed, leaned my face toward the opening, peered into the foyer.</p><p>Darkness.</p><p>Enough with the cloak and dagger.</p><p>&#x201c;Chynna?&#x201d;</p><p>My voice echoed. I expected silence. That would be the next step, right? No reply. I slipped the door open a little, took a tentative step forward. . . .</p><p>&#x201c;Dan? I&#x2019;m in the back. Come in.&#x201d;</p><p>The voice was muffled, distant. Again I didn&#x2019;t like this, but there was no way I was backing out now. Backing out had cost me too much throughout my life. My hesitation was gone. I knew what had to be done now.</p><p>I opened the door, stepped inside, and closed the door behind me.</p><p>Others in my position would have brought a gun or some kind of weapon. I had thought about it. But that just doesn&#x2019;t work for me. No time to worry about that now. No one was home. Chynna had told me that. And if they were, well, I would handle that when the moment came.</p><p>&#x201c;Chynna?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go to the den, I&#x2019;ll be there in a second.&#x201d;</p><p>The voice sounded . . . off. I saw a light at the end of the hall and moved toward it. There was a noise now. I stopped and listened. Sounded like water running. A shower maybe.</p><p>&#x201c;Chynna?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just changing. Out in a second.&#x201d;</p><p>I moved into the low-lit den. I saw one of those dimmer-switch knobs and debated turning it up, but in the end I chose to leave it alone. My eyes adjusted pretty quickly. The room had cheesy wood paneling that looked as if it were made from something far closer to vinyl than anything in the timber family. There were two portraits of sad clowns with huge flowers on their lapels, the kind of painting you might pick up at a particularly tacky motel&#x2019;s garage sale. There was a giant open bottle of no-name vodka on the bar.</p><p>I thought I heard somebody whisper.</p><p>&#x201c;Chynna?&#x201d; I called out.</p><p>No answer. I stood, listened for more whispering. Nothing.</p><p>I started toward the back, toward where I heard the shower running.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right out,&#x201d; I heard the voice say. I pulled up, felt a chill. Because now I was closer to the voice. I could hear it better. And here was the thing I found particularly strange about it:</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t sound at all like Chynna.</p><p>Three things tugged at me. One, panic. This wasn&#x2019;t Chynna. Get out of the house. Two, curiosity. If it wasn&#x2019;t Chynna, who the hell was it and what was going on? Three, panic again. It had been Chynna on the phone&#x2014;so what had happened to her?</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t just run out now.</p><p>I took one step toward where I&#x2019;d come in, and that was when it all happened. A spotlight snapped on in my face, blinding me. I stumbled back, hand coming up to my face.</p><p>&#x201c;Dan Mercer?&#x201d;</p><p>I blinked. Female voice. Professional. Deep tone. Sounded oddly familiar.</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201d;</p><p>Suddenly there were other people in the room. A man with a camera. Another with what looked like a boom mike. And the female with the familiar voice, a stunning woman with chestnut brown hair and a business suit.</p><p>&#x201c;Wendy Tynes, <i>NTC News</i>. Why are you here, Dan?&#x201d;</p><p>I opened my mouth, nothing came out. I recognized the woman from that TV newsmagazine . . .</p><p>&#x201c;Why have you been conversing online in a sexual manner with a thirteen-year-old girl, Dan? We have your communications with her.&#x201d;</p><p>. . . the one that sets up and catches pedophiles on camera for all the world to see.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you here to have sex with a thirteen-year-old girl?&#x201d;</p><p>The truth of what was going on there hit me, freezing my bones. Other people flooded the room. Producers maybe. Another cameraman. Two cops. The cameras came in closer. The lights got brighter. Beads of sweat popped up on my brow. I started to stammer, started to deny.</p><p>But it was over.</p><p>Two days later, the show aired. The world saw.</p><p>And the life of Dan Mercer, just as I somehow knew it would be when I approached that door, was destroyed.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>WHEN MARCIA MCWAID FIRST SAW HER daughter&#x2019;s empty bed, panic did not set in.

But one sunny afternoon, a woman collapses and dies on this great Paris landmark. Can a bee-sting really be the cause of death? Or is there a more sinister explanation? Enter young bookseller Victor Legris. Present on the Tower at the time of the incident, he is determined to find out what actually happened. In this dazzling evocation of late 19th Century Paris, we follow Victor as his investigation takes him all over the city. But what will he do when the deaths begin to multiply and he is caught in a race against time?</p><p>Claude Izner is the pen-name of two sisters, Liliane Korb and Laurence Lefevre. Both booksellers on the banks of the Seine, they are experts on nineteenth-century Paris.Bookseller Victor Legris investigates when several people die of apparent bee stings during the Universal Exposition of 1889 in Paris. The disparate group of victims includes a rag picker, a poor relation, a wealthy collector, and a budding opera star. Did these people really die of bee stings, or are they being murdered? If so, why? Victor looks for the connection between the four, and to his horror it appears that the link may be either Kenji, the man who raised him after his father&#x2019;s death, or Tasha, the woman he is beginning to love. This leisurely paced mystery, steeped in the sights and sounds of nineteenth-century Paris and the Universal Exposition&#x2014;and full of details about the newly open Eiffel Tower&#x2014;pairs a methodical investigation with&nbsp;a love interest, carefully researched historical facts, and details of the literary world of the time. The only quibble is that the many secondary characters are rather underdeveloped and, hence, difficult to keep straight. Izner is the pseudonym for two sisters who are secondhand booksellers. --Sue O'Brien</p><h2>Falstaff: Give Me Life (1) (Shakespeare&#39;s Personalities)</h2><p>From Harold Bloom, one of the greatest Shakespeare scholars of our time comes &#x201c;a timely reminder of the power and possibility of words [and] the last love letter to the shaping spirit of Bloom&#x2019;s imagination&#x201d; (front page, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>) and an intimate, wise, deeply compelling portrait of Falstaff&#x2014;Shakespeare&#x2019;s greatest enduring and complex comedic characters.<br><br>Falstaff is both a comic and tragic central protagonist in Shakespeare&#x2019;s three Henry plays: <i>Henry IV</i>, Parts One and Two, and <i>Henry V</i>. He is companion to Prince Hal (the future Henry V), who loves him, goads, him, teases him, indulges his vast appetites, and commits all sorts of mischief with him&#x2014;some innocent, some cruel. Falstaff can be lewd, funny, careless of others, a bad creditor, an unreliable friend, and in the end, devastatingly reckless in his presumption of loyalty from the new King.<br> <br>Award-winning author and esteemed professor Harold Bloom writes about Falstaff with the deepest compassion and sympathy and also with unerring wisdom. He uses the relationship between Falstaff and Hal to explore the devastation of severed bonds and the heartbreak of betrayal. Just as we encounter one type of Anna Karenina or Jay Gatsby when we are young adults and another when we are middle-aged, Bloom writes about his own shifting understanding of Falstaff over the course of his lifetime. Ultimately we come away with a deeper appreciation of this profoundly complex character, and this &#x201c;poignant work&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly,</i> starred review) as a whole becomes an extraordinarily moving argument for literature as a path to and a measure of our humanity.<br> <br>Bloom is mesmerizing in the classroom, wrestling with the often tragic choices Shakespeare&#x2019;s characters make. &#x201c;In this first of five books about Shakespearean personalities, Bloom brings erudition and boundless enthusiasm&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred review) and his exhilarating <i>Falstaff</i> invites us to look at a character as a flawed human who might live in our world.</p><p>Harold Bloom is Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University. He has written more than sixty books, including <i>Cleopatra: I Am Fire and Air</i>,<i> Falstaff: Give Me Life</i>, <i>The Western Canon</i>,<i> Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human</i>, and <i>How to Read and Why.</i> He is a MacArthur Prize fellow, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the recipient of many awards, including the Academy&#x2019;s Gold Medal for Criticism. He lives in New Haven, Connecticut.Falstaff CHAPTER 1<p></p> Prelude<p></p> <br>I fell in love with Sir John Falstaff when I was a boy of twelve, almost seventy-five years ago. A rather plump and melancholy youth, I turned to him out of need, because I was lonely. Finding myself in him liberated me from a debilitating self-consciousness.<br> <br>He has never abandoned me for three-quarters of a century and I trust will be with me until the end. The true and perfect image of life abides with him: robustly, unforgettably, forever. He exposes what is counterfeit in me and in all others.<br> <br>If Socrates had been born in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x2019;s England and had gone to Eastcheap, a London street, to purchase meat, he might have stopped for ale or sack at the Boar&#x2019;s Head Tavern. There he would have encountered Falstaff and traded wit and wisdom with him. I have not the skill to portray that imaginary meeting. Only a fusion of Aristophanes and Samuel Beckett could manage it. Decades ago, sharing Fundador with Anthony Burgess on a Manhattan evening in 1972, I suggested he would be able to venture on the task but he demurred.<br> <br>A lifelong Falstaffian at eighty-six, I have come to believe that if we are to represent Shakespeare by only one play, it ought to be the complete Henry IV, to which I would add Mistress Quickly&#x2019;s description of the death of Falstaff in act 2, scene 3 of Henry V. I think of this as the Falstaffiad rather than the Henriad, as scholars tend to call it.<br> <br>Shakespeare never surpassed the alternation between the royal court, the rebels, and Eastcheap in these three plays. The transitions between high and low are so deft they seem invisible.<br> <br>Is there in all Western literature a portrayal of ambivalence to match Hal/Henry V? In regard to both the King, his father, and to Hotspur, his rival, the Prince is a whirligig of contraries. Toward Falstaff his long gathering ambivalence has turned murderous. Hal&#x2019;s imagination is haunted by the wishful image of Sir John Falstaff on the gallows. The wretched Bardolph is hanged by his new King and former companion, in Henry V, without regret. Had Falstaff not departed for Arthur&#x2019;s bosom, Mistress Quickly&#x2019;s poignant mistake for Abraham&#x2019;s bosom, he would have dangled by Bardolph&#x2019;s side.<br> <br>More than a few scholars of Shakespeare share Hal&#x2019;s ambivalence toward Falstaff. This no longer surprises me. They are the undead and Falstaff is the everliving. I wonder that the greatest wit in literature should be chastised for his vices since all of them are perfectly open and cheerfully self-acknowledged. Supreme wit is one of the highest cognitive powers. Falstaff is as intelligent as Hamlet. But Hamlet is death&#x2019;s ambassador while Falstaff is the embassy of life.<br> <br>The heroic vitalists in literature include Rabelais&#x2019; Panurge, Chaucer&#x2019;s Wife of Bath, and Cervantes&#x2019; Sancho Panza. Falstaff reigns over them. John Ruskin taught that the only wealth is life. Sir John Falstaff, the Socrates of Eastcheap, embodies that truth.<br> <br>What is the essence of Falstaffianism? My late friend and drinking companion Anthony Burgess told me it was freedom from the state. Anthony and I never quite agreed on that though indeed no societal standards ever could abide Falstaff. I recall telling Burgess that for me the essence of Falstaffianism was: do not moralize. Computing Falstaff&#x2019;s flaws is trivial: he bulges with them. Hal, like his father Bolingbroke, is the essence of hypocrisy. They are Machiavels. Bolingbroke, who becomes Henry IV, is a usurper and a regicide. His nonsensical obsession is that he will expiate the murder of Richard II by leading yet another crusade to capture Jerusalem. He dies indeed in the chamber of his palace called Jerusalem. Hal, when he becomes Henry V, leads a land grab to capture France. A crusade is what one might expect of Prince Hal, who hungers like Hotspur for what both call honor. Falstaff destroys the validity of that appetite in a reply to Hal in act 5, scene 1 in the first part of Henry IV:<br> <br>Hal: Why, thou owest God a death. [Exit.]<br> <br>Falstaff: &#x2019;Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before his day. What need I be so forward with him that calls not on me? Well, &#x2019;tis no matter; honour pricks me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? No: or an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no. Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it? he that died o&#x2019; Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no. Doth he hear it? no. &#x2019;Tis insensible, then. Yea, to the dead. But will it not live with the living? no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore I&#x2019;ll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so ends my catechism.<br> <br>act 5, scene 1, lines 126&#x2013;40<br> <br>If there could be a religion of vitalism this would do very well for its catechism. Falstaff mocks faith, killing the insane notion that we owe God our death. Knowingly he also mocks both Hal and himself. Disreputable and joyous, he speaks to a world that goes from violence to violence.<br> <br>Falstaff immediately became the most popular of all Shakespearean personalities, and remains so. The audiences at the Globe and the readers who purchased quartos found little to moralize against in Sir John. His being overflows and that excess brings new meanings to our minds. Exuberance in itself is a shadowy virtue and can be dangerous to the self and to others, but in Falstaff it generates more life.<br> <br>I am weary of being accused of sentimentalizing Falstaff. I once told a benign interviewer:<br> <br>Remember, there are three great poets whom neither you nor I would want to have lunch or dinner with, or even a drink&#x2014;Fran�ois Villon, Christopher Marlowe, and Arthur Rimbaud. At the least they would rob us, at the most they might kill us. Sir John Falstaff wouldn&#x2019;t kill us, but he would certainly gull us one way or another, and perhaps pick our pockets very adeptly.<br> <br>In that sense the sublime Falstaff is bad news. Against myself I cite Orson Welles, whose Chimes at Midnight remains a neglected masterpiece. Welles made the film, an adaptation of the Henriad, and played it as tragedy. The film had a supporting cast of brilliant stars including Keith Baxter as Hal, John Gielgud as Henry IV, Jeanne Moreau as Doll Tearsheet, Margaret Rutherford as Mistress Quickly, and Ralph Richardson as the Narrator. Welles called Falstaff a &#x201c;gloriously life-affirming good man . . . defending a force&#x2014;the old England&#x2014;which is going down. What is difficult about Falstaff . . . is that he is the greatest conception of a good man, the most completely good man, in all drama. His faults are so small and he makes tremendous jokes out of little faults. But his goodness is like bread, like wine.&#x201d;<br> <br>I may be unique in my total agreement with Orson Welles. Is there anyone else in Henry IV whose goodness is like bread, like wine? They are scurvy politicians like the King and the brilliant Prince Hal and most of the rebels. They are smug thugs like Prince John and high-spirited killing machines like the captivating Hotspur and Douglas. Falstaff&#x2019;s followers&#x2014;Bardolph, Nym, the outrageous Pistol&#x2014;are entertaining rogues, and Mistress Quickly and Doll Tearsheet are better company than the Lord Chief Justice. Justice Shallow is charmingly absurd and his crony Silence augments the irreality.<br> <br>Falstaff is as bewildering as Hamlet, as infinitely varied as Cleopatra. He can be apprehended but never fully comprehended. There is no end to Falstaff. His matrix is freedom but he dies for love.<br> <br>Oliver Goldsmith in his &#x201c;A Reverie at the Boar&#x2019;s Head Tavern, Eastcheap&#x201d; is a beacon:<br> <br>The character of old Falstaff, even with all his faults, gives me more consolation than the most studied efforts of wisdom. I here behold an agreeable old fellow, forgetting age, and showing me the way to be young at sixty-five. Sure I am well able to be as merry, though not so comical as he. Is it not in my power to have, though not so much wit, at least as much vivacity? Age, care, wisdom, reflection, begone! I give you to the winds. Let&#x2019;s have t&#x2019;other bottle; here&#x2019;s to the memory of Shakespeare, Falstaff, and all the merry men of Eastcheap!<br> <br>Falstaff is possibly closer to seventy-five than sixty-five. Dr. Samuel Johnson, who discovered and fostered Goldsmith, similarly celebrated Falstaff while expressing moral disapproval. Maurice Morgann is the true ancestor of all Falstaffians. His An Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir John Falstaff, published in 1777, was criticized by Johnson, who facetiously suggested Morgann should next try to prove Iago a good man. The issue was the supposed cowardice of the Fat Knight. It is an accusation first made by Prince Hal, who fiercely needs to persuade Falstaff to confess his cowardice. Why?<br> <br>Crossing the threshold to the sinuous consciousness of Hal/Henry V, second King of the Lancaster line, we confront the wavering presence of ontology itself, the immanence of Sir John Falstaff. Why did Shakespeare invent Falstaff?<br> <br>Literary character is always an invention and indebted to prior inventions. Shakespeare invented literary character as we know it. He reformed our expectations for the verbal imitation of personality and the reformation appears to be permanent and uncannily inevitable. The Bible and Homer powerfully render personages yet their characters are mostly unchanging. They age and die within their stories but their modes of being do not develop.<br> <br>Shakespeare&#x2019;s personalities do. The representation of character in his plays now seems normative and indeed became the accepted mode almost immediately. Shakespeare&#x2019;s personalities have little in common with those of Ben Jonson or Christopher Marlowe. Shakespeare&#x2019;s originality in portraying women and men founds itself upon The Canterbury Tales of Geoffrey Chaucer.<br> <br>Throughout Shakespeare, vitality transmutes into doom-eagerness. Richard II, the protagonist of the history that begins the Henriad, is a moral masochist whose luxurious self-indulgence in despair augments his overthrow by the usurper Bolingbroke, who thus becomes Henry IV. In the personality of Richard II, Shakespeare prefigures that element in all of us by which we render bad situations even worse through our own hyperbolic language.<br> <br>Falstaff is different. His zest for life pervades his torrent of language and laughter. Hotspur is the incarnation of doom-eagerness. His mode though is opposite to that of Richard II. His vaunting language assaults the frontiers of what is possible. Hal, his father&#x2019;s son, distrusts his own vitalism, and yet goes to Falstaff to be confirmed in it. The royal pupil proves unforgiving toward his teacher. Kings have no friends, only followers, and Sir John Falstaff is no man&#x2019;s follower.<br> <br>Directors, actors, playgoers, readers need to understand that Falstaff, most magnificent of wits, is tragicomic. Unlike Hotspur and Hal, he is not one of the fools of time. Dr. Johnson said that love was the wisdom of fools, and the folly of the wise. I cannot think of a better description of my hero Sir John Falstaff.</p><h2>Garden Tools (Everyday Things)</h2><p>Garden tools are inseparable from gardens, and yet, while the history of gardens has been exhaustively explored, the story of garden tools has been virtually ignored - until now. As authors Suzanne Slesin and Guillaume Pellerin reveal in this lushly designed and nostalgia-filled volume, embedded in these familiar, everyday tools is a rich history that documents the tastes and passions of gardeners through the ages.<br>Illustrated with hundreds of full-color photographs of garden tools, as well as with vintage lithographs, engravings, posters, ads, and even decorative plates depicting garden implements, the book follows the gardening cycle, from "Preparing the Earth" to "Harvesting," and each chapter features the traditional tools used in that phase of gardening. The "Sowing" chapter, for instance, presents an array of dibbers, trowels, seeders, and terra-cotta pots, while the "Pruning" chapter offers a host of knives, grafters, pincers, saws, scythes, hatchets, billhooks, and a mind-boggling variety of pruners.<br>Today, vintage garden tools are being rediscovered and appreciated anew as much for their ingeniousness as for their sculptural and timeless form. Garden Tools casts these humble objects in a whole new light, and anyone who loves to dig a spade into the earth or prune a rosebush will find the book irresistibly compelling.</p><p></p><h2>The Way They SEE It, A Book for EVERY PARENT About the Art Children Make (ARTistic Pursuits)</h2><p>Do you wish you could look inside your child&#39;s mind to see what is behind the artwork your preschooler just handed to you?

Marcel Duchamp to Walter Arensberg 23 January 1954, New York </p><p>Jan 23. 1954 210 W. 14th St N.Y.C </p><p>Dear Walter Thursday 21st received your large envelope with all the documents and I telegraphed Fiske (Fiske=Fiske Kimball) to announce my coming to Phila Friday. It turned out that Fiske was coming to N.Y. on Friday (22nd) and I arranged by telephone to meet him in N.Y., which I did. (After seeing him I received a copy of his letter to you dated Jan. 21St) -------------------- From my conversation with him he seems to have finally grasped the reasons of your dissatisfaction and will change his previous propositions to the following new ones : I. No mentioning at all of a "Modern Museum" (and that you should insist upon) II The Collection opening won't be connected with anything else.thus constituting a III This opening should take place as early as possible. "Modern Museum." I suggested that if there are difficulties to be get ready in a month or 2, they could easily be ready by the end of April or May Even June would be a good moment- But not wait until October. IV The objections based on the readiness of the catalogue fall of themselves if the catalogue need not be ready for the opening-- A good catalogue could hardly be ready by October anyway- So why not work at it with great care and spend all the time necessary to make it a "monument". As for the visitors on the opening day they could have a black and white printed listing of all the works without any reproductions or literature. V The objections based on the lack of time to obtain adequate publicity do not hold water, for this kind of a show is not a "produit de beaute"(cosmetic product) which _ needs heavy advertising. On the contrary a few press releases will start the ball rolling and "Life" has already arranged with Phila to start on the project of along article with color plates to appear at the time (or probably after as they always do) of the opening date.- "Life" needs two months for the color plates alone, although they are not made in Europe-- --The "Art News Annual", if they want to run a long survey of the Collection, comes out in November. --These are the 2 important items of "dignified" publicity and the opening date (May or June) would "cooperate" perfectly with the "Life" article and the "Art News Annual" VI. The framing of the pictures can be simplified as indicated in one of Fiske's letters. I have seen Sweeney's framing at the "Guggenheim" and approve of it completely. It would be simple enough to keep the good frames and use the "strip system" to replace the inadequate frames, without loss of time. VII As to editing the catalogue of the 20'th' Century painting and sculpture Fiske said that he has asked Clifford to submit a number of pages and have you decide.- I know Clifford and like him very much but I don't know about his writing. Soby also would be a good choice for editing- in my opinion. I can't think of anyone in particular whom I like better than those two. (Soby= James Thrall Soby) (Henry Clifford (1904-1974), curator of Paintings at the PMA 1942-1964; writes Arensberg catalog introduction.) After all it is primarily a question of translating into words the inner tenor of the Collection in all its aspects, more than a general dissertation on modern art. I don't like Shapiro's approach to art in general- because he uses art to write about Shapiro. He is a funny kind of a poet. (Meyer Shapiro (1904-1996) Professor of Art History at Columbia University) </p><p>This is a resume of my conversation with Fiske yesterday- Hope that he will keep his promise to open before Summer, without any "Modern Museum" strings attached. </p><p>VIII Another point concerning myself alone is that I would like to postpone the showing of my large glass- I have to do some repairing on it and I am afraid I might not be ready in time.- Moreover, to avoid any misunderstanding I think that every painting or sculpture shown at the opening should belong strictly to the collection. IX- Another mere piece of news is that I married last Saturday Teeny Matisse, the ex-wife of Pierre: "En vieillissant, I' ermite se fait diable"- Affectueusement Marcel (Alexina Sattler a.k.a.

The Family had spliced and intertwined so often over the centuries that almost all adults except one&#x2019;s own parents were called Aunt and Uncle, and all the children were lumped together as &#x201c;the cousins.&#x201d;</p><p>To the dozens and dozens of North cousins, &#x201c;town&#x201d; was a distant thing, like &#x201c;ocean&#x201d; and &#x201c;space&#x201d; and &#x201c;government.&#x201d; What did they care about such things, except that during school hours, Auntie Tweng or Auntie Uck would rap them on the head with a thimbled finger if they didn&#x2019;t come up with the right answers?</p><p>School was something the children endured in the mornings, so they could spend the afternoons learning how to create the things that commoners called fairies, ghosts, golems, trolls, werewolves, and other such miracles that were the heritage of the North family.</p><p>It was their heritage, but not every child inherited. Great-uncle Zog was notorious for muttering, &#x201c;The blood&#x2019;s too thin, the blood&#x2019;s too thin,&#x201d; because it was his considered opinion that the Norths had grown weak in the thirteen and a half centuries since the Evil One closed the gates. &#x201c;Why else do we have so many weaklings who can&#x2019;t send their outself more than a hundred yards?&#x201d; he said once. &#x201c;Why else do we have so few children who can raise a clant out of anything sturdier than pollen and dust, or heartbind with one of their clan? Why do we have these miserable drekkas like Danny in every generation? Putting them in Hammernip Hill hasn&#x2019;t made us stronger. Nothing makes us stronger.&#x201d;</p><p>Danny heard this when he was eleven, when it wasn&#x2019;t a sure thing yet that he was a drekka. Plenty of children didn&#x2019;t show any talent till they were in their teens. Or so Mama said, reassuring him; but from Great-uncle Zog&#x2019;s words Danny began to doubt her. How could it be &#x201c;plenty&#x201d; of children who showed no talent when Danny was now the only child in the Family over the age of nine who couldn&#x2019;t even figure out whether he had an outself, let alone send it out to explore. When the other kids used their outselves to spy on Danny&#x2019;s school papers and copy them, he couldn&#x2019;t even detect that they were there, let alone stop them.</p><p>&#x201c;Drive them away, can&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; demanded Aunt Lummy. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the only decent student in this school, but they&#x2019;re all getting the same marks as you because you let them cheat!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know how they&#x2019;re doing it,&#x201d; said Danny, &#x201c;but how can I drive them away when I can&#x2019;t see them or feel them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just make yourself big,&#x201d; said Aunt Lummy. &#x201c;Hold on to your own space. Don&#x2019;t let them crowd you!&#x201d;</p><p>But these words meant nothing to Danny, no matter how he tried to act them out, and the cheating went on until Lummy and the other Aunts who taught the school were forced to make separate tests, one for Danny and one for all the others at his grade level. The instant result was that by age twelve, Danny was soon the only student in his grade level, the others having been put back where they belonged. In the outside world, Danny would have been doing ninth grade work, two years ahead of his age.</p><p>The other kids resented him more than ever, and therefore taunted him or froze him out as a drekka. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not one of us,&#x201d; they said&#x2014;often in those exact words. During free time they refused to let him come along on any of their escapades; he was never chosen for a team; he was never told when one of the Aunts was sharing out cookies or some other treat; and he always had to check his drawer for spiders, snakes, or dog poo. He got used to it quickly, and he knew better than to tell any of the adults. What good would it do him? How much fun would he have if some adult forced the others to take him along? What kinds of pranks would they do if they had been whipped for pooing his clean clothes?</p><p>So in this idyllic world of fairies and ghosts, gods and talking animals, Danny was a profoundly solitary child.</p><p>He knew everybody; everybody was kin to him. But he had been made ashamed of everything he did well, and even more ashamed of everything he could not do, and he regarded even those of the cousins who treated him kindly as if their kindness were pity. For who could genuinely like a boy so unworthy, whose existence meant no more than this: that the bloodlines of the North family were weak and getting weaker, with Danny the weakest of them all.</p><p>The irony was that Danny had been kept as a child apart since he was born&#x2014;but for the opposite reason. His father, Alf, a Rockbrother with an affinity for pure metals, had found a way to get inside the steel of machines and make them run almost without friction, and without lubrication. It was such a useful and unprecedented skill that he had been made ruler of the Family, and was therefore renamed as Odin; but Danny called him Baba.</p><p>Danny&#x2019;s mother, Gerd, was only slightly less remarkable, a lightmage who had learned to change the color of reflected light so that she could make things nearly invisible, or hide them in shadows, or make them glow as bright as the sun. For years Alf and Gerd had been forbidden to marry by old Gyish, who was then the Odin, for fear that the joining of two such potent bloodlines might create something awful&#x2014;a gatemage, which the Norths were forbidden ever to have again, or a manmage, which all the Families were sworn to destroy.</p><p>But when Gyish retired after losing the last war, and machine-mage Alf was made Odin in his place, the Family voted almost unanimously to allow the marriage. Danny&#x2019;s birth was the result, as close to a royal child as the Norths had had in many generations.</p><p>In his early childhood, Danny was pampered by all the adults. He was the golden boy, and great things were expected of him. He had been bright as a child&#x2014;quick to read, clever with all the family languages, dextrous with his fingers, an athletic runner and leaper, curious to a fault, and clever of tongue so he could make almost anyone laugh. But as he got older, these traits could not make up for his utter lack of harmony with any of the magics of the Family.</p><p>Danny tried everything. He gardened alongside the cousins who had a way with herbs and trees and grasses&#x2014;the ones who, as adult mages, would continue to make the North farms so astonishingly productive. But the seeds he planted grew weakly, and he could not feel the throbbing pulse of a tree.</p><p>He roamed the woods with those who had a way with animals&#x2014;the ones who, if they could only form a deep bond with wolf or bear or (failing everything grand) squirrel or snake, would become Eyefriend or Clawbrother and roam the world in animal shape whenever they wished. But the creatures ran from him, or snarled or snapped at him, and he made no friends among the beasts.</p><p>He tried to understand what it meant to &#x201c;serve&#x201d; stone or water, wind or the electricity of lightning in the air. But the stones bruised his fingers and moved for him only if he threw them; the wind only blew his hair into a tangled mop; and storms and ponds left him wet, cold, and powerless. Far from being precocious, with magic he was slow. Worse than slow. He was inert, making no visible progress at all.</p><p>Yet, except for the loneliness, he didn&#x2019;t hate his life. His long rovings in the woods were a pleasure to him. Since neither tree nor animal was drawn to him, he simply ran, becoming swift and tireless, mile after mile. At first he ran only within the limits of the family compound, because the trees that guarded the perimeter would snatch at him and then give the alarm, bringing the adult Seedguards and even Uncle Poot, the only Sapkin in the Family right now, to warn him not to leave.</p><p>But during this past winter&#x2014;perhaps because the trees were dormant and less alert&#x2014;he had found three different routes that allowed him to avoid the sentinel trees entirely.

Despite centuries of observation, each year brings the discovery and description of several entirely new avian species and hundreds of other taxonomic "splits" or "lumps" based on DNA data. In this arena of continual and increasing taxonomic change, The Clements Checklist presents the most up-to-date and most widely endorsed compendium of the more than 9800 species of birds recognized by the scientific and birding communities. This completely revised sixth edition is current as of January 1, 2007, and incorporates hundreds of updates since the last edition. In taxonomic sequence, it provides the scientific and English name of each species and a description of the worldwide range of each species and subspecies.</p><p>The most established resource on the taxonomy and biogeography of birds for the world birding community, The Clements Checklist is the official world checklist of the American Birding Association (ABA) and is used as the authoritative reference in the birding competitions and listing activities of this preeminent North American organization for serious birders.</p><p>Features of The Clements Checklist include:</p><p>*comprehensive indexes with all taxa listed by English and scientific names;<br>*tables and maps showing the world distribution of total bird species and endemics by geographic area, which will be of special interest to conservationists; and<br>*space to record the location and date of individual sightings, providing the user with a personalized ornithological journal.</p><p>The checklist is being continually updated by the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology.

Ellis has crafted a landmark biography that brings to life in all his complexity the most important and perhaps least understood figure in American history, George Washington. With his careful attention to detail and his lyrical prose, Ellis has set a new standard for biography.<br><br>Drawing from the newly<i> </i>catalogued Washington papers at the University of Virginia, Joseph Ellis paints a full portrait<b> </b>of George Washington&#x2019;s life and career&#x2013;from his military years through his two terms as president. Ellis illuminates the difficulties the first executive confronted as he worked to keep the emerging country united in the face of adversarial factions. He richly details Washington&#x2019;s private life and illustrates the ways in which it influenced his public persona. Through Ellis&#x2019;s artful narration, we look inside Washington&#x2019;s<i> </i>marriage and his subsequent entrance into the upper echelons of Virginia&#x2019;s plantation society. We come to understand that it was by managing his own<i> </i> large debts to British merchants that he experienced firsthand the imperiousness of the British Empire. And we watch the evolution of his attitude toward slavery, which led to his emancipating his own slaves in his will. Throughout, Ellis peels back the layers of myth and uncovers for us Washington in the context of eighteenth-century America, allowing us to comprehend the magnitude of his accomplishments and the character of his spirit and mind.<b><i><br></i></b><br>When Washington died in 1799, Ellis tells us,<i> </i>he was eulogized as &#x201c;first in the hearts of his countrymen.&#x201d; Since then, however, his image has been chisled onto Mount Rushmore and printed on the dollar bill. He is on our landscape and in our wallets but not, Ellis argues, in our hearts. Ellis strips away the ivy and legend that have grown up over the Washington statue and recovers the flesh-and-blood man in all his passionate and fully human prowess.<br><br>In the pantheon of our republic&#x2019;s founders, there were many outstanding individuals. And yet each of them&#x2013;Franklin, Hamilton, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison&#x2013; acknowledged Washington to be his superior, the only indispensable figure, the one and only &#x201c;His Excellency.&#x201d; Both physically and politically, Washington towered over his peers for reasons this book elucidates. <i>His Excellency</i> is a full, glorious, and multifaceted portrait of the man behind our country&#x2019;s genesis, sure to become the authoritative biography of George Washington for many decades.</p><p>As commander of the Continental army, George Washington united the American colonies, defeated the British army, and became the world's most famous man. But how much do Americans really know about their first president? Today, as Pulitzer Prize-winner Joseph J. Ellis says in this crackling biography, Americans see their first president on dollar bills, quarters, and Mount Rushmore, but only as "an icon--distant, cold, intimidating." In truth, Washington was a deeply emotional man, but one who prized and practiced self-control (an attribute reinforced during his years on the battlefield).<p> </p><p> Washington first gained recognition as a 21-year-old emissary for the governor of Virginia, braving savage conditions to confront encroaching French forces. As the de facto leader of the American Revolution, he not only won the country's independence, but helped shape its political personality and "topple the monarchical and aristocratic dynasties of the Old World." When the Congress unanimously elected him president, Washington accepted reluctantly, driven by his belief that the union's very viability depended on a powerful central government. In fact, keeping the country together in the face of regional allegiances and the rise of political parties may be his greatest presidential achievement.</p><p> </p><p> Based on Washington's personal letters and papers, <i>His Excellency</i> is smart and accessible--not to mention relatively brief, in comparison to other encyclopedic presidential tomes. Ellis's short, succinct sentences speak volumes, allowing readers to glimpse the man behind the myth. <i>--Andy Boynton</i></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com Exclusive Content</strong> <br> <strong>Curious about George?</strong> <br><i>Amazon.com reveals a few facts about the legendary first president of the United States</i>.</p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Washington bust by Jean Antoine Houdon. <br>Courtesy of the Mt.

George Washington never threw a silver dollar across the Potomac River--in fact, to do so from the shore of his Mount Vernon home would have been physically impossible. <br></p><p> </p><p> 3. George Washington did not wear wooden teeth. His poorly fitting false teeth were in fact made of cow's teeth, human teeth, and elephant ivory set in a lead base.<br></p><p> </p><p> 4. Early in his life, Washington was himself a slave owner. His opinions changed after he commanded a multiracial army in the Revolutionary War. He eventually came to recognize slavery as "a massive American anomaly."<br></p><p> </p><p> 5. In 1759, having resigned as Virginia's military commander to become a planter, Washington married Martha Dandridge Custis. Washington&#x2019;s marriage to the colony's wealthiest widow dramatically changed his life, catapulting him into Virginia aristocracy.<br></p><p> </p><p> 6. Scholars have discredited suggestions that Washington's marriage to Martha lacked passion, as well as the provocative implications of the well-worn phrase "George Washington slept here."<br></p><p> </p><p> 7. Washington held his first public office when he was 17 years old, as surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia.<br></p><p> </p><p> 8. At age 20, despite no prior military experience, Washington was appointed an adjutant in the Virginia militia, in which he oversaw several militia companies, and was assigned the rank of major.<br></p><p> </p><p> 9. As a Virginia aristocrat, Washington ordered all his coats, shirts, pants, and shoes from London. However, most likely due to the misleading instructions he gave his tailor, the suits almost never fit. Perhaps this is why he appears in an old military uniform in his 1772 portrait.<br></p><p> </p><p> 10. In 1751, during a trip to Barbados with his half-brother Lawrence, Washington was stricken with smallpox and permanently scarred.

For a moment she lay still, heart racing, staring groggily into the darkness, not sure what had awakened her or why she felt so frightened. It took only a moment or so for her to realize that she was lying in her own bed, in her own bedroom, listening to the familiar hum of the air conditioner as it kept the sweltering heat of the July night at bay and smelling the comforting aroma of her own smooth clean sheets. Her potbellied teddy bear, a poignant memento of her late father, sat stolidly in its accustomed spot on the bedside table. She could just see the comforting shape of it by the faint glow of the alarm clock.<br><br>She must have had a nightmare. That would explain why she was curled up in a tight little ball under the bedclothes when she usually slept sprawled on her stomach; it would account for the now-slowing thud of her heart; it would explain her sense of -- there was no other word for it -- dread.<br><br>Something's wrong.<br><br>Although the words were distinct, the urgent whisper was in her head. She was all alone in her bedroom, all alone in the whole huge upstairs of her house. Sid, the dog, was obviously spending another night in the guest room.<br><br>At the thought, Julie felt her stomach knot. She had gone downstairs around eleven, to find her husband sitting on the couch in the den watching TV.<br><br>"I'll be up after the news," he'd said. Not wanting to start a fight -- all they did lately was fight -- she'd crossed her fingers and gone back upstairs to bed without uttering so much as a cross or demanding word. But here it was -- she focused on the clock -- at two minutes after midnight, and she was still alone in their bed.<br><br>Maybe -- maybe he was still coming. Maybe he was watching Letterman. Maybe tonight Leno had an especially fascinating guest.<br><br>Get real, she told herself, uncurling her arms and legs as anger edged out fear. And maybe the Pope was a Protestant, too.<br><br>Listen.<br><br>Her attention immediately refocused. Trying not to be creeped out, Julie put out a hand, groping for the switch to the bedside lamp.<br><br>Then she heard it, and froze.<br><br>The distant sound -- vibration really -- of the garage door going up made her eyes widen and her fists clench.<br><br>Her heart gave an odd little leap. Her stomach heaved. She forced herself to take a pair of deep, calming breaths.<br><br>Despite all her hopes, all her prayers, it was happening again.<br><br>Oh, God, what should she do?<br><br>Julie Carlson didn't know it, but she had less than an hour left to live.<br><br>Other than a single light in a downstairs room, her house was dark. It was a big house in an exclusive gated community just west of Charleston, and, if all went according to plan, in a few minutes she was going to be all alone in it.<br><br>Then he would emerge from the shadows beneath the rustling palmettos in her side yard, break in through her back door, and creep up the stairs to the first door on the left. That door opened into the master bedroom, where she should already -- it was a few minutes after midnight -- be sound asleep.<br><br>Surprise, surprise.<br><br>Roger Basta allowed himself a small smile. This was going to be fun. The thought of what he was going to do to Julie Carlson made his breathing quicken. He'd been watching her for weeks, getting the household schedule down, making his plans, anticipating. Tonight he got to enjoy the fruits of all that labor.<br><br>Sometimes, and this was one, he loved what he did for a living.<br><br>The light went out downstairs. The house was now totally dark.<br><br>Just a few minutes more.<br><br>He fingered the snapshot in his pocket. It was too dark for him to be able to see it, but he was nearly as familiar with the image on it as he was with his own face in the mirror. Julie Carlson in a white bikini, slim and tanned and laughing, poised to dive into the swimming pool in her own backyard.<br><br>He'd taken it himself three days before.<br><br>One of the quartet of garage doors that faced his position rose, and seconds later a big black Mercedes purred silently down the driveway. The husband was leaving, right on schedule.<br><br>The garage door closed again. The Mercedes turned left at the end of the driveway, and drove away toward the interstate some five miles distant. The house was once again dark and quiet. <br><br>Everything was going down as expected.<br><br>The burglar alarm would be off, which made his job just that much easier. He had a window of maybe three and a quarter hours to get in and out before the husband returned. He would need far less.<br><br>Although he might want to linger over this one. Remembering the picture, he smiled. He definitely wanted to linger over this one.<br><br>Julie Carlson was a babe.<br><br>His instructions had been to make the hit look like anything but the professional, targeted job it was.<br><br>His reply had been, Can do.<br><br>Crouching, Basta set the small black satchel he carried on the carpet of golf-course-quality grass that covered the lawn and unzipped it. The steamy July heat, complete with swarms of hungry mosquitoes and a faint fruity scent, wrapped uncomfortably around him. It reminded him that he was wearing long pants and a cotton turtleneck, both black, on a night that cried out for shorts and not much else. A quick rummage through the contents reassured him that everything he might need was in the bag: burglary tools, duct tape, a small flashlight, a thin nylon cord and a pencil to use as a garrote, a box of surgical gloves, another of condoms. He touched his knit cap, making sure it fit tightly around his head and over his eyebrows. He'd shaved his body completely so as not to leave telltale hairs at the scene, but shaving his head and eyebrows would, he feared, make him too memorable to those who might be questioned in the aftermath of the crime. The last thing he wanted was to be memorable.<br><br>Besides, his thinning gray hair gave him an innocuous look, he felt. Countless people usually saw him in the days before a hit -- neighbors, passersby, convenience-store clerks, trash collectors -- but nobody ever remembered him, because he looked like a fifty-something Joe Average. DNA notwithstanding, the cap worked. The first two hadn't had time to dislodge it before he'd had them duct-taped into immobility, and Julie Carlson wouldn't either.<br><br>He was that good.<br><br>Sliding the flashlight into his pocket, he rezipped the bag, picked up his pistol, stood up and headed around to the back of the house. The swimming pool sparkled in the moonlight. Lush pots of tropical flowers gave off a heady scent. Cicadas and crickets and tree frogs sang.<br><br>South Carolina would be one of his favorite states, he thought, if only it wasn't so damned hot and humid in the summer.<br><br>The back door, the sliding one opening onto the stone patio and the swimming pool, was his target.<br><br>In a matter of minutes he'd be inside.<br><br>Piece of cake. The alarm was off, the locks were laughable, the woman was alone, and they didn't even own a dog. Might as well hang out a sign: Come and get me.<br><br>A light came on downstairs.<br><br>Basta froze in his tracks in the act of reaching for the doorknob, frowning at the window that was suddenly glowing warmly from within. This was unexpected. He retreated a few stealthy paces to the concealing shadow of an enormous magnolia, his senses on high alert. He'd been casing the house for three weeks, and she'd never once turned on a light after her husband was gone. Was she sick? Did they have company? No, he couldn't have missed that.<br><br>What gave?<br><br>The light went off as suddenly as it had come on, and the house was dark and still once more. He stared meditatively at the looming facade, the shiny black windows, the two doors that he could see, probing the darkness for her with every instinct he possessed. He was so attuned to her now as predator to victim that he fancied he could almost hear her breathing through the brick walls.<br><br>Where was she?<br><br>A sound made him turn his head sharply. It came from the side of the house where he'd waited until just moments before. Alert as a dog on the hunt, taking care to stay deep in the shadows, he retraced his steps until he once more stood beneath the palmettos. His eyes widened as he saw that another of the garage doors was open now.<br><br>His pistol came up, but there was no way he could use it.<br><br>He could do nothing but watch as Julie Carlson's silver Jaguar nosed out of the garage, gathered speed going down the driveway, then turned left at the street and vanished like a bat into the night.<br><br>Just as quick as that.<br><br>He was left to look blankly back at an empty house as, with a barely audible thump, the garage door closed again.<br><br>She was gone. It took a minute or so for that incontrovertible fact to sink in. When it did, he felt empty, cheated. A surging anger at having his careful plans disrupted threatened to swamp his previously good mood.<br><br>Could she have somehow known he was there? Basta looked quickly around, wary of a trap. Given the group he worked for, a double-cross was never beyond the realm of possibility.<br><br>Then good sense reasserted itself. There was no trap; he was too valuable to the organization for that. And she could not possibly have known he was there unless she was psychic.<br><br>The most logical explanation was that some sort of emergency had arisen.

In this remarkable book, real-life girlfriends Carmen Renee Berry and Tamara Traeder explore the depths and complexities of women's relationships and the joy, sustenance, and power they bring. The ideal gift for special friends, <i>Girlfriends </i>celebrates the steadfast, wonderful women in our lives.</p><p>As important as friends are to women--essential, after all, to their identity as human beings--other roles in their lives get most of the ink: their lovers, spouses, children, and family. <i>Girlfriends</i> lovingly--and somewhat exhaustively--spotlights female comradeship. This book (which screams, "Buy me as a gift!") is simply a collection of women speaking about aspects of their female friendships to the indefatigable interviewer-slash-authors. Major topics of the book include girlhood adventures, friendships during transitions such as marriage and children, remembering friends, et cetera. In an odd little postscript, <i>Girlfriends</i> lists methods of female bonding such as theme parties, things with quilts and teacups, and other rituals. After all the words that precede it, such a section seems like gilding the lily.<p> Relationships with lovers (male or female) thrum with a sexual undertone that works against the special distanced intimacy of friendship. As <i>Girlfriends</i> never tires of pointing out, only another woman knows what it is like to be a woman. A powerful antidote to alienation, friendships are a prime ingredient in a woman's life well-lived.</p><b>Carmen Renee Berry</b> is a <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author who has written or cowritten more than 25 books, including <i>Aunties: Our Older, Cooler, Wiser Friends</i>; <i>Girlfriends for Life</i>; <i>A Girlfriend&#x2019;s Gift</i>; <i>Girlfriends Talk About Men</i>; and <i>When Helping You Is Hurting Me</i>.

It is an art of adjustment, whose chief instrument is the construction of fictions by which men may manage to live. Thought is to be tested not by correspondence to an objective reality (that fiction is neatly disposed of) nor by its mirroring in consciousness an objective external world. Thought is to be tested by its fruits. The constructions of thought are not copies of or transcripts of reality; they are programs, guess-work plans; possible programs for operation. Their validity is to be measured not by verisimilitude but by value. The fruits of thought are not &#x201c;true,&#x201d; but especially where they are false, it may be important to act as if they were true... Vaihinger&#x2019;s chief originality consists in his defining of fictions and his distinction of fictions from hypotheses on the one hand, and from dogmatisms on the other. An hypothesis is a tentative discovery about the universe; a fiction is a deliberate, often clearly false and internally contradictory invention of thought... Evolution is the hypothesis that man is descended from the lower animals. We assume that we can indirectly turn to the remote facts which would justify that hypothesis. But the concept of infinity in the calculus, the atom and the ether in physics, the economic man in Adam Smith, are deliberate self-contradictory fictions, and fictions at variance with all experience. But though they are not only imaginary, false to the reality they allegedly represent and logically incoherent, they nevertheless facilitate thought and proper action. They are vital lies, human conveniences. They are the faiths, the palpably false faiths, the clearly useful falsities by which we live... The discovery that fictions were fictions has led, in the past, says Vaihinger, to an abandonment of them, and a turning to other fictions believed to be truer. Pathetic and foolish adventure! What the race needs is more faith in its own effective imaginations. The myths that it has told itself, the world pictures that it has made, are not to be dismissed because they are found to be creations of the imagination. They tally with no world and they carry the canker of logical inconsistency within them. The important thing is their utility; their human scope and mortal relevance. If we ceased making fictions, we should cease altogether to be. Let us beware to plunge from fruitful fictions to less fruitful ones that masquerade as truths and are really dogmatisms.

The text consists of approximately 200 appealing full-color photographs, supplemented by a few pages of text on pheasant history and classification and brief descriptions of the species and varieties pictured. This volume could be described as a pheasant sampler for the general reader who would like to learn a little more about this group of birds and who also appreciates quality animal photography. There is no attempt to be comprehensive, but those familiar with only a few species and varieties beyond the Ringneck Pheasant and the Indian Blue Peafowl (peacock) will be pleased to discover many new and unusual birds, including the Tragopan, Koklass, Monal, Fireback, and Great Argus.

She lives with her husband, two children, a dog, and four cats in Texas.</p>CHAPTER <br>ONE <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Late August <br>He tangled his fingers in her long, thick, ebony tresses, her sighs of pleasure making his blood singe his veins. Her feminine curves were a heady delight to a man starved for her. <br>Golden skin speaking of Spanish heritage and as smooth as satin called him to touch more of her. He lay on his side, her body pressed against him. His hand glided past the indent of her waist and over a gently flared hip down to her thigh. <br>Her legs parted instantly. His lungs seized when his fingers delved into the black curls, trimmed and partially shaved, hiding her sex. <br>&#x201c;Please,&#x201d; she whispered. <br>Her voice, seductive and low, beckoned him, urged him. And he wasn&#x2019;t going to disappoint. <br>He groaned, his cock swelling even more, when her back arched and her nails dug into his shoulders. Her breathy sighs filled the room as he caressed the sensitive flesh of her sex. <br>It wasn&#x2019;t until she shook from need that he finally dipped a finger inside her. He ground his teeth together at the feel of her slick heat. <br>She was everything he wanted and more, so much more. To finally have her in his bed, to have his hands on her&nbsp;&#x2026; it was almost too good to be true. <br>Her eyes opened, and he looked into dark pools of desire. She clung to him, her lips parted as her hips rocked against him. <br>He rolled her onto her back and settled between her legs. She grinned up at him, daring him to take her. His arousal grazed her sex, causing her to gasp at the sensation. <br>He fisted his hands in the pillow and brought his raging body back under control. He would have her, but he wanted her screaming in pleasure first. Only then would he fill her with his cock. <br>With a dip of his head, he bent and closed his mouth around a turgid nipple. His tongue circled the peak before he began to suckle. <br>She cried out and held his head between her hands. He moved to her other breast and teased that nipple until she was writhing beneath him. <br>Now, now he would kiss down her body until his lips were on her sex. He would bring her to the brink several times before he allowed her to climax. <br>Then he would plunge inside her, have her legs wrap around him as he brought them to ecstasy. <br>He kissed the valley between her breasts, but before he could place another kiss on her sweet skin, she rolled him onto his back and straddled him. <br>His heart missed a beat. She was a magnificent sight with her wealth of midnight hair falling around her shoulders to lay alongside her full, tempting breasts. <br>Her chest rose and fell rapidly. He was caught in her fawn-colored gaze. For the first time in his life, he wasn&#x2019;t in control of the lovemaking. She was. <br>And it thrilled him far more than was comfortable. <br>Her full lips tilted up in the barest of smiles. A smile that said she knew exactly what she was doing to him. And she loved it. <br>He swallowed heavily, his rod jumping with anticipation. His balls tightened when she reached down and took him in hand. Somehow he kept his hands in the sheets, fisted tightly. Sweat broke out over his body as he fought to keep still for her. <br>Only for her. No other woman had ever commanded him in such a way, and he feared no other ever would. <br>She was on her knees, her entrance above his arousal while she ran her hands up and down his length. She was teasing him as he planned to tease her. <br>He&#x2019;d never ached for a woman before. Not once had he hungered to have a certain woman in his arms. But <i>she</i> changed everything. <br>No longer could he hold off from touching her. He cupped her bountiful breasts and flicked his thumbs over her nipples. In response, she swirled her thumb over the head of his shaft. <br>He groaned and lifted his hips. His cock came in contact with the soft folds of her sex, and his control snapped. <br>As if she knew he had gone over the brink, she lowered herself onto him. He was mindless, feral with need. With a jerk, he pulled her down as he raised his hips until he was fully seated inside her. She groaned, her head thrown back and the ends of her hair brushing his thighs. <br>For a second, he couldn&#x2019;t move. Her tight, slick walls held him suspended between agony and pleasure, torment and release. He knew in that moment that she commanded his body. <br>His fear was that her reach would extend past his body to his heart, or worse&#x2014;his soul. <br>With his heart hammering in his chest, she began to rock her hips. He closed his eyes to feel every delightful, perfect minute of her. <br>There was a slight thumping that intruded upon him, but he was determined to ignore it. He rolled over, taking her with him. He lost her in the blankets. Panic seized him as he searched, only to find himself clutching a pillow instead of her soft body. <br>Phelan opened his eyes to the pillow and flopped onto his back. He threw an arm over his eyes as his cock ached for relief. <br>&#x201c;Fuck,&#x201d; he ground out in vexation. <br>The dreams he was having of Aisley intensified every night, leaving him aroused and unsatisfied no matter how many times he tried to pleasure himself afterward. <br>He had been on her trail for almost two months now. He still wasn&#x2019;t sure why he let her walk out of that nightclub after he first kissed her. <br>He hadn&#x2019;t expected her to run. Women didn&#x2019;t run from him. <br>But Aisley did. <br>That was part of why she intrigued him, but it went beyond that. She was different. That one kiss they shared had rocked him to his very core. No matter how he tried, he couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking about her. Or wanting her. <br>His mobile phone vibrated on the bedside table. Phelan pondered not answering it, but he knew they would only call again. <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; he demanded as he answered the call. <br>&#x201c;What the hell is your problem?&#x201d; Charon&#x2019;s voice asked with a note of irritation. <br>Phelan rubbed his eyes with his thumb and forefinger. He hoped the call would cool his ardor, but if it didn&#x2019;t, another cold shower to start the day would. &#x201c;It doesna matter. What&#x2019;s the reason for the call?&#x201d; <br>The pause on the other end of the line had Phelan glancing over at the clock. The bright green lights staring back at him told him it was 2:33 in the morning. <br>&#x201c;Charon,&#x201d; Phelan urged as the silence grew. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re getting desperate,&#x201d; Charon said tightly. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s been no sign of Jason.&#x201d; <br>Jason Wallace. The very reason Phelan had to take extra time away from tracking Aisley. Jason was a <i>drough</i>, a Druid who gave part of his soul to the Devil in order to use black magic. <br>Phelan untangled his legs from the sheets and sat up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen nothing of him. Maybe Jason is dead as we&#x2019;ve suspected all along.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I need to know for certain.&#x201d; <br>Phelan drew in a deep breath, hating the weariness and worry he heard in his friend&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;Laura is safe. She&#x2019;s with you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Are any of us ever really safe with a <i>drough</i> about?&#x201d; Charon asked. &#x201c;My wife asks me to forget about Wallace, but I hear Laura on the phone with the other Druids talking about ways to use their magic to look for him.&#x201d; <br>Phelan scrubbed a hand down his face. How many times had the <i>mies</i> used the magic nature gave them to look for Wallace? The <i>mies</i> were the good Druids and luckily on their side. <br>Despite the Druids&#x2019; magic and the powers within Warriors like Phelan, they had found nothing of Jason Wallace. The Druids had potent magic, but as a Highlander with a primeval god inside him, Phelan should have found Jason by now. <br>He had been alone for so long, and he thought it would always be that way. Then he found Charon. An unlikely friendship had begun between them that brought them as close as brothers. <br>After one monster of a betrayal, Phelan found it difficult to trust. Charon had changed all of that. Phelan would do anything for the man he considered a brother. <br>However, it wasn&#x2019;t just for Charon that he searched for Wallace. It was for himself. He wanted to put the past behind him. He wanted to think of a future that included peace&#x2014;or as much peace as a Warrior could ever achieve. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m no&#x2019; giving up,&#x201d; Phelan stated. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m tired of fighting <i>droughs</i>. First Deirdre, then Declan, and now Jason. It has to end sometime.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Laura keeps reminding me there can no&#x2019; be good without evil. There&#x2019;s a balance.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Aye. This last time evil nearly won.&#x201d; <br>Phelan hated to think how close they had been to losing the last battle. Fortunately, Charon had made some powerful friends at Dreagan Distillery. Those &#x201c;friends&#x201d; ended up being dragon shifters. <br>The Dragon Kings had been around since the beginning of time. It was on their land the battle had been fought with the dragons in the skies and Warriors on the ground. <br>&#x201c;It was too damn close,&#x201d; Charon agreed softly. <br>&#x201c;Any word from Rhys or the others at Dreagan?&#x201d; <br>Charon grunted. &#x201c;Nothing. They have their hands full right now, but they&#x2019;re keeping an eye out for us.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What of the selmyr?&#x201d; <br>Just thinking of the hideous beasts made Phelan bite back a growl. The selmyr were ancient creatures that fed off magical entities. The Druids and Warriors were perfect meals. The only thing the selmyr feared were the Dragon Kings. <br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; Charon said with a sigh. &#x201c;The waiting is wearing on Laura.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;All will be well, my friend,&#x201d; Phelan vowed. &#x201c;I can stop my search and help you keep watch over Laura.&#x201d; <br>Phelan would do it in a heartbeat after everything Charon had done for him, but he prayed he wouldn&#x2019;t have to give up searching for Aisley. He had to find her, to taste her sweet lips once more and know if the kiss had been a one-time thing, or if there was something between them. <br>&#x201c;Nay. You and Malcolm are the only ones out looking for Wallace.&#x201d; <br>The first ghost of a grin p...</p><h2>Extreme Weather (Outdoor Life): 214 Tips for Surviving Nature&#39;s Worst</h2><p>Extreme weather has the ability to leave us devastated, but with the easy-to-follow <i>Extreme Weather Survival Manual </i>you&#x2019;ll be ready for anything Mother Nature throws at you.

The two most common products available to radar users across the world are called &#x201c;reflectivity&#x201d; and &#x201c;velocity.&#x201d; Reflectivity is used to make the maps you&#x2019;re probably used to seeing, with rainbow-colored shading that shows where the heaviest rain and snow are pouring down at the moment.<br> &nbsp;<br> Velocity, meanwhile, tells us the speed that a storm is traveling by using the Doppler effect to determine how fast, say, a raindrop is moving. So, if the raindrop is moving east at 45 MPH, we can deduce that the winds in that region of the storm are blowing at around 45 MPH. This measure is extremely helpful in severe weather situations, especially during tornadoes.<br> &nbsp;<br> The velocity data can rat out a tornado hiding in the rain. Most radar velocity images are shown in red and green, with reds showing wind moving away from the radar, and greens showing wind moving toward the radar. When all those red and green colors show strong winds moving in opposite directions very close to one another, you often have strong circulation in a thunderstorm or a tornado on your hands. These regions of rotation can be very subtle and hard to spot during weak tornadoes, and obvious during the most violent storms.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Hey, Good Looking: A Novel</h2><p>With lively prose, unforgettable characters, and a touch of mischievous wit, Fern Michaels creates vivid reading experiences in all of her acclaimed <i>USA Today</i> and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling novels.

Ridiculously wide hoop skirts, yards and yards of hot petticoats, and cruelly tight corsets supported by whalebone or steel made women faint at the drop of the hat: "What was proper about that?" So Amelia, being so very improper, sets out to revolutionize the world for women.<p> Not only does she start her own newspaper and try to change the voting laws, she also popularizes a new fashion. This bold new garb shocks the proper ladies, but frees all others to move, digest, breathe, and think about something other than keeping from fainting (such as voting and working). Named for their best spokesperson, bloomers marked the start of a kinder, gentler approach to women's fashion--and women's rights.</p><p> Shana Corey's lightly humorous voice is perfect for this true story about the 19th-century women's rights activist. A note at the end provides horrifying and fascinating information about women's restrictive clothing (corsets sometimes displaced internal organs!) and the dress reform that Amelia Bloomer spearheaded. Chesley McLaren's breezy, exuberant illustrations charmingly reflect her background in fashion design and illustration. (Ages 5 to 8) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Grade 1-3-A funny, disdainful look at the early 19th-century proprieties that set the scene for the women's rights movement. Amelia Bloomer thought proper ladies were silly; it was silly that they couldn't vote, and it was silly that they were not supposed to work. "So she started her own newspaper and went to work on that." Text and pictures flow easily and energetically with comic views of ladies in their lavish, lusciously colored dresses. Several scenes cascade down the page, intertwined with type resembling hand-printed letters. The story keeps a clear focus on the social constraints of confining clothing. Independent-thinker Amelia is thrilled when her friend Elizabeth Cady Stanton brings her cousin to visit. "Libby was not wearing a dress!" Her poufy pantaloons and period shoes are first seen in ebullient splendor on the end pages. Needless to say, Amelia finds them "brilliant," makes a pair for herself, and promotes them in her newspaper. Author and illustrator conclude adroitly, connecting Amelia's influence to present-day modes of dress. Over time, the early "bloomers" went out of style. "But did people really forget all about Amelia Bloomer and her improper ideas?" The answer is laid firmly to rest on the final page with its assortment of contemporary pants-clad women. The concluding essay sketches a bit more detail about Amelia Bloomer, the attire of her time, and women's continued interest in "bloomers." Dressed in a well-shaped story, this entertaining lesson in social history will be especially enjoyed as read-aloud fare.<br><i>Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Paranoid Style in American Politics</h2><p>This timely reissue of Richard Hofstadter's classic work on the fringe groups that influence American electoral politics offers an invaluable perspective on contemporary domestic affairs.In <i>The Paranoid Style in American Politics</i>, acclaimed historian Richard Hofstadter examines the competing forces in American political discourse and how fringe groups can influence &#x2014; and derail &#x2014; the larger agendas of a political party. He investigates the politics of the irrational, shedding light on how the behavior of individuals can seem out of proportion with actual political issues, and how such behavior impacts larger groups. With such other classic essays as &#x201c;Free Silver and the Mind of 'Coin' Harvey&#x201d; and &#x201c;What Happened to the Antitrust Movement?, &#x201d; <i>The Paranoid Style in American Politics</i> remains both a seminal text of political history and a vital analysis of the ways in which political groups function in the United States.</p><p>These essays deal with the conditions that have given rise to the extreme right of the 1950s and the 1960s, and the origins of certain characteristic problems of the earlier modern era when the American mind was beginning to respond to the facts of industrialism and world power.Born in 1916, <b>Richard Hofstadter</b> was one of the leading American historians and public intellectuals of the 20th century. His works include <i>The Age of Reform</i>, <i>Anti-intellectualism in American Life</i>, <i>Social Darwinism in American Thought, 1860-1915</i>, <i>The American Political Tradition</i>, and others. He died in 1970.</p><h2>Woman With Guitar: Memphis Minnie&#39;s Blues</h2><p>Universally recognized as one of the greatest blues artists, Memphis Minnie (1897&#x2013;1973) wrote and recorded hundreds of songs, among them the famous "Bumble Bee Blues," "I'm Talking About You," and "What's the Matter with the Mill?" Blues people as diverse as Muddy Waters, Johnny Shines, Big Mama Thornton, and Chuck Berry have acknowledged her as a major influence. At a time when most female vocalists sang Tin Pan Alley material, Minnie write her own lyrics and accompanied her singing with magnificent guitar-playing. Thanks to her merciless imagination and dark humor, her songs rank among the most vigorous and challenging popular poetry in any language. Although organized feminism was at it's lowest ebb, Memphis Minnie, a black working-class woman, called no man master, defied gender stereotypes, and exemplified a radically adventurous life-style that makes most careers of the '20s and '30s seem dull by comparison. <i>Woman with Guitar</i> is the first full-length study of the life and work of this extraordinary free spirit, focusing on the lively interplay between Minnie's evolving artistry and the African American community in which she lived and worked. Drawing on folklore, psychoanalysis, critical theory, women's studies, and surrealism, the Garons' inspired explorations of Minnie's songs illuminate the poetics of popular culture as well as the largely hidden history of working-class women's self emancipation.</p><p><i>Woman with Guitar</i> is <b>Beth Garon's</b> first book.

He is currently working on the ABC line of comics, which also includes Tomorrow Stories, Promethea, Top Ten and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (all published by Titan). Art Adams is a widely respected artist who has worked on many major titles, including Hellboy, Danger Girl, Gen 13, Tom Strong&#39;s Terrific Tales and X-Men.When acclaimed writer Moore (<i>Watchmen, </i>1987; <i>From Hell,</i> 2000) returned to mainstream comics in the late 1990s, he created several brand-new costumed adventurers, the most enduring of them "science hero" Tom Strong. Raised experimentally on a remote island and gifted with physical and mental perfection, Strong protects civilization with the aid of his similarly extraordinary family and companions. This collection reprints issues of the anthology comic book <i>Tom Strong's Terrific Tales</i>, which features stories that tend to be even goofier than Tom's customarily tongue-in-cheek exploits; for example, in this batch, a picture-book-style children's story entirely in verse and an adventure presented as a Saturday-morning cartoon. Moore's collaborators here are unconventional, too: Peter Kuper, for whom Moore wrote a script in Kuper's favored, wordless format; <i>Batman </i>animator Bruce Timm; and Peter Bagge, who depicts the Strongs as a hilariously dysfunctional family in the mode of the Bradleys in Bagge's <i>Hate</i>. Other scripts not by Moore but still a cut above standard superhero fare include flashback tales depicting Tom's childhood and time-traveling superheroine Jonni Future. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Obinze is the kind of successful "Big Man" he'd scorned in his youth, and Ifemelu has become an "Americanah"--a different version of her former self, one with a new accent and attitude. As they revisit their shared passion--for their homeland and for each other--they must face the largest challenges of their lives.</p><p>CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE's work has appeared in various publications, including<i> </i>the<i> New Yorker, Granta</i> and <i>Zoetrope.</i> She is the author of <i>The Thing Around Your Neck</i> and of 2 novels, <i>Purple Hibiscus</i> and <i>Half of a Yellow Sun,</i> which won the Orange Prize and was a NBCC Finalist. A recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship, she divides her time between the United States and Nigeria.<p>Princeton, in the summer, smelled of nothing, and although Ifemelu liked the tranquil greenness of the many trees, the clean streets and stately homes, the delicately overpriced shops, and the quiet, abiding air of earned grace, it was this, the lack of a smell, that most appealed to her, perhaps because the other American cities she knew well had all smelled distinctly. Philadelphia had the musty scent of history. New Haven smelled of neglect. Baltimore smelled of brine, and Brooklyn of sun-warmed garbage. But Princeton had no smell. She liked taking deep breaths here. She liked watching the locals who drove with pointed courtesy and parked their latest model cars outside the organic grocery store on Nassau Street or outside the sushi restaurants or outside the ice cream shop that had fifty different flavors including red pepper or outside the post office where effusive staff bounded out to greet them at the entrance. She liked the campus, grave with knowledge, the Gothic buildings with their vine-laced walls, and the way everything transformed, in the half-light of night, into a ghostly scene. She liked, most of all, that in this place of affluent ease, she could pretend to be someone else, someone specially admitted into a hallowed American club, someone adorned with certainty.<br> &nbsp;<br> But she did not like that she had to go to Trenton to braid her hair. It was unreasonable to expect a braiding salon in Princeton&#x2014;the few black locals she had seen were so light-skinned and lank-haired she could not imagine them wearing braids&#x2014;and yet as she waited at Princeton Junction station for the train, on an afternoon ablaze with heat, she wondered why there was no place where she could braid her hair. The chocolate bar in her handbag had melted. A few other people were waiting on the platform, all of them white and lean, in short, flimsy clothes. The man standing closest to her was eating an ice cream cone; she had always found it a little irresponsible, the eating of ice cream cones by grown-up American men, especially the eating of ice cream cones by grown-up American men in public. He turned to her and said, &#x201c;About time,&#x201d; when the train finally creaked in, with the familiarity strangers adopt with each other after sharing in the disappointment of a public service. She smiled at him. The graying hair on the back of his head was swept forward, a comical arrangement to disguise his bald spot. He had to be an academic, but not in the humanities or he would be more self-conscious. A firm science like chemistry, maybe. Before, she would have said, &#x201c;I know,&#x201d; that peculiar American expression that professed agreement rather than knowledge, and then she would have started a conversation with him, to see if he would say something she could use in her blog. People were flattered to be asked about themselves and if she said nothing after they spoke, it made them say more. They were conditioned to fill silences. If they asked what she did, she would say vaguely, &#x201c;I write a lifestyle blog,&#x201d; because saying &#x201c;I write an anonymous blog called <i>Raceteenth or Various Observations About American Blacks (Those Formerly Known as Negroes) by a Non-American Black</i>&#x201d; would make them uncomfortable. She had said it, though, a few times. Once to a dreadlocked white man who sat next to her on the train, his hair like old twine ropes that ended in a blond fuzz, his tattered shirt worn with enough piety to convince her that he was a social warrior and might make a good guest blogger. &#x201c;Race is totally overhyped these days, black people need to get over themselves, it&#x2019;s all about class now, the haves and the have-nots,&#x201d; he told her evenly, and she used it as the opening sentence of a post titled &#x201c;Not All Dreadlocked White American Guys Are Down.&#x201d; Then there was the man from Ohio, who was squeezed next to her on a flight. A middle manager, she was sure, from his boxy suit and contrast collar. He wanted to know what she meant by &#x201c;lifestyle blog,&#x201d; and she told him, expecting him to become reserved, or to end the conversation by saying something defensively bland like &#x201c;The only race that matters is the human race.&#x201d; But he said, &#x201c;Ever write about adoption? Nobody wants black babies in this country, and I don&#x2019;t mean biracial, I mean black. Even the black families don&#x2019;t want them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He told her that he and his wife had adopted a black child and their neighbors looked at them as though they had chosen to become martyrs for a dubious cause. Her blog post about him, &#x201c;Badly-Dressed White Middle Managers from Ohio Are Not Always What You Think,&#x201d; had received the highest number of comments for that month. She still wondered if he had read it. She hoped so. Often, she would sit in caf�s, or airports, or train stations, watching strangers, imagining their lives, and wondering which of them were likely to have read her blog. Now her ex-blog. She had written the final post only days ago, trailed by two hundred and seventy-four comments so far. All those readers, growing month by month, linking and cross-posting, knowing so much more than she did; they had always frightened and exhilarated her. SapphicDerrida, one of the most frequent posters, wrote: I&#x2019;m a bit surprised by how personally I am taking this. Good luck as you pursue the unnamed &#x201c;life change&#x201d; but please come back to the blogosphere soon. You&#x2019;ve used your irreverent, hectoring, funny and thought-provoking voice to create a space for real conversations about an important subject. Readers like SapphicDerrida, who reeled off statistics and used words like &#x201c;reify&#x201d; in their comments, made Ifemelu nervous, eager to be fresh and to impress, so that she began, over time, to feel like a vulture hacking into the carcasses of people&#x2019;s stories for something she could use. Sometimes making fragile links to race. Sometimes not believing herself. The more she wrote, the less sure she became. Each post scraped off yet one more scale of self until she felt naked and false.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ice-cream-eating man sat beside her on the train and, to discourage conversation, she stared fixedly at a brown stain near her feet, a spilled frozen Frappuccino, until they arrived at Trenton. The platform was crowded with black people, many of them fat, in short, flimsy clothes. It still startled her, what a difference a few minutes of train travel made. During her first year in America, when she took New Jersey Transit to Penn Station and then the subway to visit Aunty Uju in Flatlands, she was struck by how mostly slim white people got off at the stops in Manhattan and, as the train went further into Brooklyn, the people left were mostly black and fat. She had not thought of them as &#x201c;fat,&#x201d; though. She had thought of them as &#x201c;big,&#x201d; because one of the first things her friend Ginika told her was that &#x201c;fat&#x201d; in America was a bad word, heaving with moral judgment like &#x201c;stupid&#x201d; or &#x201c;bastard,&#x201d; and not a mere description like &#x201c;short&#x201d; or &#x201c;tall.&#x201d; So she had banished &#x201c;fat&#x201d; from her vocabulary. But &#x201c;fat&#x201d; came back to her last winter, after almost thirteen years, when a man in line behind her at the supermarket muttered, &#x201c;Fat people don&#x2019;t need to be eating that shit,&#x201d; as she paid for her giant bag of Tostitos. She glanced at him, surprised, mildly offended, and thought it a perfect blog post, how this stranger had decided she was fat. She would file the post under the tag &#x201c;race, gender and body size.&#x201d; But back home, as she stood and faced the mirror&#x2019;s truth, she realized that she had ignored, for too long, the new tightness of her clothes, the rubbing together of her inner thighs, the softer, rounder parts of her that shook when she moved. She was fat.<br> &nbsp;<br> She said the word &#x201c;fat&#x201d; slowly, funneling it back and forward, and thought about all the other things she had learned not to say aloud in America. She was fat. She was not curvy or big-boned; she was fat, it was the only word that felt true. And she had ignored, too, the cement in her soul. Her blog was doing well, with thousands of unique visitors each month, and she was earning good speaking fees, and she had a fellowship at Princeton and a relationship with Blaine&#x2014;&#x201c;You are the absolute love of my life,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d written in her last birthday card&#x2014;and yet there was cement in her soul. It had been there for a while, an early morning disease of fatigue, a bleakness and borderlessness. It brought with it amorphous longings, shapeless desires, brief imaginary glints of other lives she could be living, that over the months melded into a piercing homesickness. She scoured Nigerian websites, Nigerian profiles on Facebook, Nigerian blogs, and each click brought yet another story of a young person who had recently moved back home, clothed in American or British degrees, to start an investment company, a music production business, a fashion label, a magazine, a fast-food franchise. She looked at photographs of these men and women and felt the dull ache of loss, as though they had prised open her hand and taken something of hers. They were living her life. Nigeria became where she was supposed to be, the only place she could sink her roots in without the constant urge to tug them out and shake off the soil. And, of course, there was also Obinze. Her first love, her first lover, the only person with whom she had never felt the need to explain herself. He was now a husband and father, and they had not been in touch in years, yet she could not pretend that he was not a part of her homesickness, or that she did not often think of him, sifting through their past, looking for portents of what she could not name.<br> The rude stranger in the supermarket&#x2014;who knew what problems he was wrestling with, haggard and thin-lipped as he was&#x2014;had intended to offend her but had instead prodded her awake.<br> &nbsp;<br> She began to plan and to dream, to apply for jobs in Lagos. She did not tell Blaine at first, because she wanted to finish her fellowship at Princeton, and then after her fellowship ended, she did not tell him because she wanted to give herself time to be sure. But as the weeks passed, she knew she would never be sure. So she told him that she was moving back home, and she added, &#x201c;I have to,&#x201d; knowing he would hear in her words the sound of an ending.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Blaine asked, almost automatically, stunned by her announcement. There they were, in his living room in New Haven, awash in soft jazz and daylight, and she looked at him, her good, bewildered man, and felt the day take on a sad, epic quality. They had lived together for three years, three years free of crease, like a smoothly ironed sheet, until their only fight, months ago, when Blaine&#x2019;s eyes froze with blame and he refused to speak to her. But they had survived that fight, mostly because of Barack Obama, bonding anew over their shared passion. On election night, before Blaine kissed her, his face wet with tears, he held her tightly as though Obama&#x2019;s victory was also their personal victory. And now here she was telling him it was over.<br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; he asked. He taught ideas of nuance and complexity in his classes and yet he was asking her for a single reason, the cause. But she had not had a bold epiphany and there was no cause; it was simply that layer after layer of discontent had settled in her, and formed a mass that now propelled her. She did not tell him this, because it would hurt him to know she had felt that way for a while, that her relationship with him was like being content in a house but always sitting by the window and looking out.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Take the plant,&#x201d; he said to her, on the last day she saw him, when she was packing the clothes she kept in his apartment. He looked defeated, standing slump-shouldered in the kitchen. It was his houseplant, hopeful green leaves rising from three bamboo stems, and when she took it, a sudden crushing loneliness lanced through her and stayed with her for weeks. Sometimes, she still felt it. How was it possible to miss something you no longer wanted? Blaine needed what she was unable to give and she needed what he was unable to give, and she grieved this, the loss of what could have been.<br></p></p><h2>Mein Allerschonstes Worterbuch</h2><p>Used.

But when the syndicate sends the world&#x2019;s best gambler to the Rainbow&#x2019;s End craps tables to break the bank&#x2014;at the exact moment when Martin thinks he might be falling in love&#x2014;he finds himself under assault on two fronts, trying to keep his head in the game when his heart&#x2019;s not in it. Fisher made his mark more as a screenwriter than a novelist, and this 1958 thriller has cinematic flair, combining a ticking clock, a claustrophobic environment, and a crowd of personalities to exciting effect. Also intriguing are the introduction to craps and the inside-out view of a family-unfriendly Sin City. Gender relationships are definitely of the pop-cultural moment (men and women fight until they kiss), but connoisseurs of crime fiction&#x2014;especially the gambling subgenre&#x2014;will want to put their money down and watch Fisher roll. --Keir Graff</p><h2>To the Ends of the Earth: The Selected Travels of Paul Theroux</h2><p>"Travel writing at its best."<br>THE HOUSTON POST<br>Author and travel writer Paul Theroux does what no one else can: he travels to the isolated, unusual, and fascinating spots of the world, and creates an elegy to them that makes readers feel they are traveling with him.

Also, it can serve as a guide for any who wish to find out about the smallest detail of their equipment based on the few surviving specimens of the period 1760-1790. Often called frontiersmen, riflemen, backwoodsmen, scouts, woods-runners, over-mountain men, Big Knives, shirt-tail men - they all refer to the same sort of man. Two differences, however, are the terms &#39;long hunter&#39; or &#39;woodsrunner&#39; which denoted the man, who without a wife or family, lived for periods of time west of the Alleghanys, hunting and trapping and only returning to civilization to trade for a few necessities. Many still believe the myth that the War for Independence was fought by Americans from behind trees, cutting the Redcoats to pieces. Although this was the usual method of fighting on the frontiers, only a few battles of the Revolutionary War were fought in this manner. The Continental Army was trained in the same manner as European armies of the day and eventually learned to fight successfully that way. The war had to be fought in this manner, at least in the east, because the majority of the men were armed with muskets. The exception were the riflemen who did not fight in the lines, but hid behind cover and fired at will, which they could do because of the rifle&#39;s greater range and accuracy. Riflemen, who composed only five to ten percent of all the regular troops, were an important and essential part of the army. Though it can be said that the rifle was not the sole reason for the final victory, neither can it be denied that it was the arm that won the early frontier, it being used so successfully against the British and their Indian allies.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Lost City of Z (Movie Tie-In): A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon (Vintage Departures)</h2><p><b>The #1 New York Times Bestseller - Now a Major Motion Picture starring Charlie Hunnam,&nbsp;Tom Holland,&nbsp;Robert Pattinson and Sienna Miller.&nbsp; </b><br><br>In 1925, the legendary British explorer Percy Fawcett ventured into the Amazon jungle, in search of a fabled civilization.

His second novel, <em>The Firm</em>, spent 47 weeks on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list, becoming the bestselling novel of 1991. The success of <em>The Pelican Brief</em>, which hit number one on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list, and <em>The Client</em>, which debuted at number one, confirmed Grisham's reputation as the master of the legal thriller. His most recent novel, <em>The Associate</em>, was published in January 2009. Read his exclusive Amazon guest review of <em>The Lost City of Z</em>:</strong> <br> <p> </p> <p>In April of 1925, a legendary British explorer named Percy Fawcett launched his final expedition into the depths of the Amazon in Brazil. His destination was the lost city of El Dorado, the &#x201c;City of Gold,&#x201d; an ancient kingdom of great sophistication, architecture, and culture that, for some reason, had vanished. The idea of El Dorado had captivated anthropologists, adventurers, and scientists for 400 years, though there was no evidence it ever existed. Hundreds of expeditions had gone looking for it. Thousands of men had perished in the jungles searching for it. Fawcett himself had barely survived several previous expeditions and was more determined than ever to find the lost city with its streets and temples of gold.</p> <p>The world was watching. Fawcett, the last of the great Victorian adventurers, was financed by the Royal Geographical Society in London, the world&#x2019;s foremost repository of research gathered by explorers. Fawcett, then age 57, had proclaimed for decades his belief in the City of Z, as he had nicknamed it. His writings, speeches, and exploits had captured the imagination of millions, and reports of his last expedition were front page news.</p> <p>His expeditionary force consisted of three men--himself, his 21-year-old son Jack, and one of Jack&#x2019;s friends. Fawcett believed that only a small group had any chance of surviving the horrors of the Amazon. He had seen large forces decimated by malaria, insects, snakes, poison darts, starvation, and insanity. He knew better. He and his two companions would travel light, carry their own supplies, eat off the land, pose no threat to the natives, and endure months of hardship in their search for the Lost City of Z.</p> <p>They were never seen again. Fawcett&#x2019;s daily dispatches trickled to a stop. Months passed with no word. Because he had survived several similar forays into the Amazon, his family and friends considered him to be near super-human. As before, they expected Fawcett to stumble out of the jungle, bearded and emaciated and announcing some fantastic discovery. It did not happen.</p> <p>Over the years, the search for Fawcett became more alluring than the search for El Dorado itself. Rescue efforts, from the serious to the farcical, materialized in the years that followed, and hundreds of others lost their lives in the search. Rewards were posted. Psychics were brought in by the family. Articles and books were written. For decades the legend of Percy Fawcett refused to die.</p> <p>The great mystery of what happened to Fawcett has never been solved, perhaps until now. In 2004, author David Grann discovered the story while researching another one. Soon, like hundreds before him, he became obsessed with the legend of the colorful adventurer and his baffling disappearance. Grann, a lifelong New Yorker with an admitted aversion to camping and mountain climbing, a lousy sense of direction, and an affinity for take-out food and air conditioning, soon found himself in the jungles of the Amazon. What he found there, some 80 years after Fawcett&#x2019;s disappearance, is a startling conclusion to this absorbing narrative.</p> <p><em>The Lost City of Z</em> is a riveting, exciting and thoroughly compelling tale of adventure.</p> <p>(Photo � Maki Galimberti)</p> <strong>A Q&amp;A with Author David Grann</strong> <p></p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> When did you first stumble upon the story of Percy Fawcett and his search for an ancient civilization in the Amazon&#x2014;and when did you realize this particular story had you in &#x201c;the grip&#x201d;?</p> <p><strong>David Grann:</strong> While I was researching a story on the mysterious death of the world&#x2019;s greatest Sherlock Holmes expert, I came upon a reference to Fawcett&#x2019;s role in inspiring Arthur Conan Doyle&#x2019;s novel <em>The Lost World</em>. Curious, I plugged Fawcett&#x2019;s name into a newspaper database and was amazed by the headlines that appeared, including &#x201c;THREE MEN FACE CANNIBALS IN RELIC QUEST&#x201d; and tribesmen &#x201c;Seize Movie Actor Seeking to Rescue Fawcett.&#x201d; As I read each story, I became more and more curious--about how Fawcett&#x2019;s quest for a lost city and his disappearance had captivated the world; how for decades hundreds of scientists and explorers had tried to find evidence of Fawcett&#x2019;s missing party and the City of Z; and how countless seekers had disappeared or died from starvation, diseases, attacks by wild animals, or poisonous arrows. What intrigued me most, though, was the notion of Z. For years most scientists had considered the brutal conditions in the largest jungle in the world inimical to humankind, but more recently some archeologists had begun to question this longstanding view and believed that a sophisticated civilization like Z might have existed. Such a discovery would challenge virtually everything that was believed about the nature of the Amazon and what the Americas looked liked before the arrival of Christopher Columbus. Suddenly, the story had every tantalizing element--mystery, obsession, death, madness--as well as great intellectual stakes. Still, I probably didn&#x2019;t realize I was fully in the story&#x2019;s &#x201c;grip&#x201d; until I told my wife that I planned to take out an extra life insurance policy and follow Fawcett&#x2019;s trail into the Amazon.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Tell us about the discovery of Fawcett&#x2019;s previously unpublished diaries and logbooks.</p> <p><strong>DG:</strong> Researching the book often felt like a kind of treasure hunt and nothing was more exciting than coming across these materials in an old chest in the house of one of Fawcett&#x2019;s grandchildren. Fawcett, who had been a British spy, was extremely secretive about his search for Z--in part because he didn&#x2019;t want his rivals to discover the lost city before he did and in part because he feared that too many people would die if they tried to follow in his wake. These old, crumbling diaries and logbooks held incredible clues to both Fawcett&#x2019;s life and death; what&#x2019;s more, they revealed a key to his clandestine route to the Lost City of Z.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> In an attempt to retrace Fawcett&#x2019;s journey, many scientists and explorers have faced madness, kidnapping, and death. Did you ever hesitate to go to the Amazon?</p> <p><strong>DG:</strong> I probably should have been more hesitant, especially after reading some of the diaries of members of other parties that had scoured the Amazon for a lost city. One seeker of El Dorado described reaching a state of &#x201c;privation so great that we were eating nothing but leather, belts and soles of shoes, cooked with certain herbs, with the result that so great was our weakness that we could not remain standing.&#x201d; In that expedition alone, some four thousand men perished. Other explorers resorted to cannibalism. One searcher went so mad he stabbed his own child, whispering, &#x201c;Commend thyself to God, my daughter, for I am about to kill thee.&#x201d; But to be honest, even after reading these accounts, I was so consumed by the story that I did not think much about the consequences--and one of the themes I try to explore in the book is the lethal nature of obsession.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> When you were separated from your guide Paolo on the way to the Kuikuro village and seemingly lost and alone in the jungle, what was going through your mind?</p> <p><strong>DG:</strong> Besides fear, I kept wondering what the hell I was doing on such a mad quest.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Paolo and you made a game of imagining what happened to Fawcett in the Amazon. Without giving anything away about <em>The Lost City of Z</em>, I was wondering if you came away with any final conclusions?</p> <p><strong>DG:</strong> I don&#x2019;t want to give too much away; but, after poring over Fawcett&#x2019;s final letters and dispatches from the expedition and after interviewing many of the tribes that Fawcett himself had encountered, I felt as if I had come as close as possible to knowing why Fawcett and his party vanished.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> In his praise for your book, Malcolm Gladwell asks a &#x201c;central question of our age&#x201d;: &#x201c;In the battle between man and a hostile environment, who wins?&#x201d; Obviously, the jungle has won many times, but it seems man may be gaining. What are your thoughts on the deforestation taking place in the Amazon?</p> <p><strong>DG:</strong> It is a great tragedy. Over the last four decades in Brazil alone, the Amazon has lost some two hundred and seventy thousand square miles of its original forest cover--an area bigger than France. Many tribes, including some I visited, are being threatened with extinction. Countless animals and plants, many of them with potential medicinal purposes, are also vanishing. One of the things that the book explores is how early Native American societies were often able to overcome their hostile environment without destroying it. Unfortunately, that has not been the case with the latest wave of trespassers.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You began this journey as a man who doesn&#x2019;t like to camp and has &#x201c;a terrible sense of direction and tend[s] to forget where [you are] on the subway and miss[es] [your] stop in Brooklyn.&#x201d; Are you now an avid outdoorsman?</p> <p><strong>DG:</strong> No. Once was enough for me!</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Early in the book, you write, &#x201c;Ever since I was young, I&#x2019;ve been drawn to mystery and adventure tales.&#x201d; What have been some of your favorite books--past and present--that fall into this category?</p> <p><strong>DG:</strong> I&#x2019;m a huge Sherlock Holmes fan, and every few years go back and read the stories again. I do the same with many of Joseph Conrad&#x2019;s novels, including <em>Lord Jim</em>. I&#x2019;m always amazed at how he produced quest novels that reflected the Victorian era and yet seem to have been written with the wisdom of a historian looking back in time. As for more contemporary authors, I read a lot of crime fiction, especially the works of George Pelecanos and Michael Connelly. I also relish books, such as Jonathan Lethem&#x2019;s <em>Motherless Brooklyn</em>, that cleverly play with this genre. Finally, there are the gripping yarns written by authors like Jon Krakauer and Nathaniel Philbrick-&#x2014;stories that are all the more spellbinding because they are true.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Brad Pitt and Paramount optioned <em>The Lost City of Z</em> in the spring. Any updates?</p> <p><strong>DG:</strong> They have hired a screenwriter and director and seem to be moving forward at a good clip.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What are you working on now?</p> <p><strong>DG:</strong> I recently finished a couple of crime stories for <em>The New Yorker</em>, including one about a Polish author who allegedly committed murder and then left clues about the real crime in his novel. Meanwhile, I&#x2019;m hoping to find a tantalizing story, like <em>The Lost City of Z</em>, that will lead to a new book.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Anything else you&#x2019;d like to add?</p> <p><strong>DG:</strong> Just that I hope that readers will enjoy <em>The Lost City of Z</em> and find the story of Fawcett and his quest as captivating as I did.</p> <p>(Photo � Matt Richman)</p> <strong>Look Inside <em>The Lost City of Z</em></strong> <p></p> <strong>Click on thumbnails for larger images</strong> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Percy Harrison Fawcett was considered &#x201c;the last of the individualist explorers&#x201d;&#x2014;those who ventured into blank spots on the map with little more than a machete, a compass, and an almost divine sense of purpose.

Kartell was founded in 1949 by <strong>Giulio Castelli</strong>, a chemical engineer with a vision to create something good from plastics, a material whose applications were still relatively unexplored. A fruitful collaboration with the great designer <strong>Gino Colombini</strong> started, who won the firm its first Compasso d&#x2019;Oro award in 1955. Particularly since the plastic-loving era of the 1960s and 70s, Kartell has become an enduring household name; from the <strong>famous designs of Anna Castelli Ferrieri and Joe Colombo in the 1960s </strong>to more recent hits such as <strong>Philippe Starck&#x2019;s Ghost Chairs </strong>or <strong>Ron Arad&#x2019;s Bookworm shelves</strong>, Kartell has consistently chosen to work with the world&#x2019;s most talented designers while <strong>reinventing plastic as a quality material for the new age</strong>.<br> <br> This survey covers <strong>the entire history of the company, decade by decade</strong>, exploring all aspects of its evolution as well as the social and technological qualities of Kartell products.

Belichick was supposed to change all that. But there were many questions: Could he turn it around? Could he win without Bill Parcells? He is smart, certainly, some would say a genius, but could he inspire and motivate a team to win it all? After his mediocre run as head coach of the Cleveland Browns, and the strange end to his relationship with Parcells and the New York Jets, what kind of head coach could he be?</p><p>Four years later, he has two Lombardi trophies in his hands, and the Patriots organization has become the gold standard in professional football. How did they do it? With unprecedented access granted by Belichick and his staff, author Michael Holley takes us deep inside the heart of a champion. A fly on the wall for two years, Holley captures Belichick at his most candid in team, coaches, and production meetings.

She is the coauthor of No Heroes: Inside the FBI's Secret Counter-Terror Force and author of the bestselling Desperados: Latin Drug Lords, U.S. Lawmen, and the War America Can't Win. <p>Ann Blackman worked at Time for more than fifteen years and spent three years as the magazine's correspondent in Moscow. She is the author of Seasons of Her Life: A Biography of Madeleine Korbel Albright.</p>The story of FBI special agent Bob Hanssen was told in David Vise's <i>The Bureau and the Mole</i> [BKL D 15 01], and now the story of this spy extraordinaire is retold, this time by two <i>Time</i> magazine reporters. In February 2001, Hanssen was arrested as a double agent for Russian intelligence after what turned out to be the biggest sellout of U.S. national security secrets in the long history of the FBI. The version of the story presented here is based on extensive interviews, many with people who have not spoken about Hanssen before, and the emphasis is on how the FBI tracked a mole, found out who he was, and laid a trap for him. Interesting, too, is the authors' account of FBI culture under J. Edgar Hoover and the differences and similarities in post-Hoover days. Calling Hanssen the "quintessential suburban dad," the authors relate how this seemingly innocuous and, frankly, rather boring man transformed himself into "one of the most damaging spies ever to work against the United States." Having access to intelligence and counterintelligence and making the decision to sell what he knew time and time again was, apparently, a way for this chronic "outsider" to exert power. The two books taken together cover every detail and nuance of the case. Buy wherever the first one proved popular. <i>Brad Hooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Yet to Lewrie it seemed to be one of infinite sadness. Though the harbour waters were sparkling and glittering, the skies were fresh-washed blue, stippled with benign and pristine brush-stroked clouds; the sun was bright; and the day was just warm enough to be mild, yet not hot enough to be oppressive; and gulls and other seabirds swooped and dove and hovered with springtime delight ... it was his last day. The morning he surrendered command of HMS <i>Jester.</i>Admiral Sir John Jervis&#x2019;s Valentine&#x2019;s Day &#x201c;present,&#x201d; following the Battle of Cape Saint Vincent, was a quick dash into Lisbon for two days Out-of-Discipline, an aboard-ship revel with the Portugee whores and something approaching a monumental drunk for all hands. And once the last doxy had been chivvied ashore, the last smuggled wine bottle tipped overside, and the last thick head had returned to normal use, they had stripped <i>Jester</i> of top-masts, stores, and artillery for her first careenage since Leghorn, the middle of &#x2019;95. Tons of weed, slime, and barnacles had been sluiced, swabbed, chipped, or fired off her hull; and what little they could do to replace missing copper sheets, or tar over and paint over, had been performed before re-floating her, giving her that long-delayed &#x201c;lick and a promise&#x201d; above the waterline, before re-stocking her, re-arming her, and setting her masts up anew.It was only then that Lewrie could announce to his men that they were off for Portsmouth to de-commission; off for Home and England! And <i>Jester&#x2019;s</i> decks had rung with whooping cheers and tears of joy!He&#x2019;d wished <i>he&#x2019;d</i> known sooner; four hands had trickled off from the working parties, entered on ship&#x2019;s books as &#x201c;Run.&#x201d; Had they known earlier that <i>Jester</i> was bound for England, they might have stayed on to see their families again and collect the pay owed them, which was nearly eighteen months overdue, which, given the times and the Navy&#x2019;s slack accounting system, was actually a little better-than-normal delay.Then again, two of them had been Italian volunteers, or some of those Maltese seamen who&#x2019;d been hired-out by the Grand Masters of Malta in &#x2019;93, after Hood had taken, then lost, the French naval base at Toulon.Lewrie was certain that their &#x201c;fly&#x201d; Purser&#x2014;the young, bespectacled Mr. Giles&#x2014;was cackling in glee somewhere aft in a stores room over their departure. Not only had they decamped without their meagre pay, but their shares in the prize-money which <i>Jester</i> had accumulated since &#x2019;94. Finding a way to make absent men &#x201c;chew tobacco&#x201d;&#x2014;purchase slop-clothing, hats, tinware, and such on a two-year spending spree as profligate as ... as drunken sailors&#x2014;to help make his books balance, Lewrie was mortal-certain! Or sign their pay over to him in total? Forge documents that he was their executor selected to hold any share of prize-money for them? Their only bloody <i>heir?</i> Lewrie had scoffed.There was little he could do to their benefit. And, after all, they&#x2019;d &#x201c;Run&#x201d;; taken &#x201c;leg-bail&#x201d; from the Fleet, from shipmates, and from his command. Now they were most-likely dead-broke and desperate for a berth in any merchant ship that&#x2019;d have them, throwing away sums that for a poor sailorman were damn&#x2019;-near princely! The Devil with &#x2019;em ... damn&#x2019; fools!So he&#x2019;d demurred and <i>hadn&#x2019;t</i> cocked a wary brow at Giles, letting him have his unofficial &#x201c;due.&#x201d; He needed him too badly to anger the smug little &#x201c;Captain Sharp,&#x201d; not at the last moments of a commission when his own accountings and financial records were to be scrutinised by a platoon of petti-fogging Admiralty clerks! Not if he didn&#x2019;t want to have some beartrap snap shut on his arse, all unsuspecting, years later!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;His cabins were stripped bare, but for guns, carriages, and the black-and-white chequer painted on the sailcloth deck covering. Ragged and scuffed, the paint scrubbed half off beneath the gun-trucks. The many light canvas and deal partitions were stacked to one corner like a set of abandoned doors or used-up stage-sets. His chests were now in a hired boat alongside. Toulon, strenuously objecting to it, was caged in a wicker basket which Aspinall held&#x2014;rather carefully, he noted, for Toulon was hissing, spitting, hunkering, and licking chops like he wished to <i>nip</i> the fool who&#x2019;d ordered him in there. Or whichever fleshy idiot got within slashing distance.Lewrie huffed a huge sigh of finality. Even after they&#x2019;d come in, there&#x2019;d been nigh on ten days&#x2019; worth of nattering with Vice-Admiral Sir Peter Parker&#x2019;s staff, in charge at Portsmouth, with the criminals at HM Dockyards, with the bewildered twits at Gun Wharf, who&#x2019;d given him permission to keep his French 8-pounders (which equalled British Long-Nines) instead of waiting to exchange for the proper 6-pounders his vessel rated ... and now vowed they had never known a <i>thing</i> about it, and who the deuce did he think he was playing fast and loose with their records? Didn&#x2019;t he know there was a war on?There&#x2019;d been a blizzard of paperwork; all the forms, ledgers, and logs, the fill-in-the-blanks documents for Sick &amp; Hurt Board, Victualling Board, Ordnance Board, powder and shot expended, in action or for gun-drill, with many &#x201c;tsk-tsks&#x201d; and mournful shakings of heads over <i>wasting</i> precious munitions without good reason. Back-stays shifted; spars lost or cracked; lumber, nails, and screws used for repairs&#x2014;how <i>necessary</i> were the repairs to ship&#x2019;s boats or bulwarks, and had the Carpenter or Bosun allotted <i>too</i> many board feet, too many bloody <i>screws!</i> to restore a shot-through cutter. Marines, accused of using too <i>little</i> boot-black or pipe clay, whilst using too many flints, expending too much powder and ball, and losing one whole musket and <i>two</i> bayonets! Having to explain, in triplicate, every lack or loss, with the replacement cost held over each unfortunate respondent&#x2019;s head until a plausible compromise could be reached!Every lack was Lewrie&#x2019;s final responsibility as captain after all, every loss or condemnation of rotten stores. Department heads were liable for lack of accountability, certainly, but in the end there were some things <i>he</i> could be dunned for. After a final, prissy, and un-satisfied <i>harumph!</i> that no outright fraud had occurred, no sin of omission or commission which might lead to pay stoppage or court-martial, the senior clerk had written Lewrie a form which deducted from the pay due him, a copy of said form to be forwarded to Admiralty for the clerks there, who could tally up his pay for three years&#x2019; service, another to go into his personnel file, one for the Portsmouth records, and one to be handed over to Lewrie for his own keeping.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;With another huge sigh, Lewrie turned his back on those great-cabins and went out the forrud passageway &#x2019;twixt the sadly empty dining coach and the still-usable chart space, to the gun-deck to face his crew.He had never de-commissioned a ship in wartime. <i>Shrike,</i> back in &#x2018;83, after the American Revolution was over; as a junior officer into <i>Telesto</i> in &#x2019;86; or sweet little <i>Alacrity,</i> a converted bomb-ketch he&#x2019;d had, his first <i>official</i> lieutenant&#x2019;s command, when she&#x2019;d come home from the Bahamas in &#x2019;89. Those were all done in time of peace and were relatively joyous occasions, for the hands had mostly been freed from the Navy, going off to civilian pursuits and the pleasures of their homes, their families, with the Fleet much reduced. Now, though ...The Royal Navy was gigantic, with nearly one hundred line-of battle ships and another hundred frigates, even more lesser ships in commission out fighting their foes, worldwide. Nearly half the hands were impressed or culled from debtors&#x2019; prisons to man those fleets, and there would be no freedom, even a brief tantalising spree, for most of his Jesters. At that moment she lay far offshore to prevent desertions, daunted by the many guard-boats which rowed Portsmouth&#x2019;s inner harbour with armed Marines aboard with orders to shoot or apprehend; with truncheon-bearing Press Gangs patrolling the docks to deter anyone who&#x2019;d swum ashore in spite of the guard-boats; or the vigilance of a ship&#x2019;s own Marines, who stood harbour-watch with loaded muskets.With the Navy so hungry for trained, experienced men who could hand, reef, and steer, this well-shaken-down crew of his could end up scattered in a heartbeat, sent off in dribs and drabs as need dictated to the foul receiving ships to idle for weeks &#x2019;til a sufficient number was mustered to draught aboard another ship newly commissioning, or one come in with casualities, desertions, and deaths from battle, accidents, or sickness in need of quick re-manning.With any luck at all&#x2014;though Lewrie rather doubted his Jesters would find any; he&#x2019;d seen lips smacking, greedy hands clapped together from other ships&#x2019; bulwarks, or the Impress Service&#x2014;they <i>might</i> allow the crew to turn over, entire, into a new ship. With a <i>great</i> deal of luck, they might be allowed to remain aboard, intact, under the newest captain! Yet <i>Jester</i> would be going alongside at Gun Wharf to remove her artillery, along a stone quay to empty her of every last movable item to lighten her, including her very last ballast-stone, her masts and spars taken away, perhaps the lower masts drawn out like bad teeth. And she&#x2019;d be weeks, perhaps as much as three months, in the hands of the dockyards being partially rebuilt. Except for those choice few holding Admiralty Warrant who were pretty-much assigned to her for life, the Fleet could not let valuable seamen sit idle.<i>What to</i> say <i>to them?</i> Lewrie puzzled sadly.He&#x2019;d most hopefully made himself a list, assuming that some word might come down from London before this moment arrived offering him future employment. As a confirmed Commander he might go into another sloop of war like <i>Jester,</i> and the Admiralty would then allow him some few of his most trusted hands to ease his transition. Should they actually <i>promote</i> him (pray Jesus!) and make him &#x201c;post&#x201d; into a 5th or 6th Rate frigate, then they&#x2019;d allow him even more of his favorites along to form the nucleus of a new and unfamiliar crew. Less than a dozen all told, even as a Post-Captain, but aboard that wished-for frigate, confronted with a sea of nigh two hundred strange faces, he&#x2019;d need every salt he knew by sight or smell.But there had <i>been</i> no word from the Lords Commissioners, from the new First Secretary, Mr. Evan Nepean; no word of future employment or promotion. He&#x2019;d been &#x201c;required and directed&#x201d; to dot the last <i>i</i> and cross the last <i>t</i> ... unlooked for and unloved (or so it seemed).He smiled a sad, grim-lipped smile for the seamen and inferior petty officers gathered on the gun-deck, nodding and acknowledging the shy, lost, and inarticulate expressions from the ship&#x2019;s &#x201c;people,&#x201d; whilst on his way to the quarterdeck. <i>God help &#x2019;em</i>, he thought; <i>they&#x2019;re just as hung on tenterhooks as I! And with a perfect right too!</i> Lewrie thought, clapping a few on the arm on his way. Many ratings aboard a warship were the whims of her captain, those informal positions aloft as yard-captains, top-mast captains, forecastle captains, the quarter gunners, and such ... places of trust and seniority, marks of personal merit and authority which got them but a few more pence per month ... Yeoman of the Powder, Yeomen of the Sheets, Bosun&#x2019;s Mate, Carpenter&#x2019;s Mate, members of a captain&#x2019;s boat-crew ...In a new ship, their qualities unknown to a new captain and his officers&#x2014;&#x2014;who already had their coterie of favorites or <i>prot�g�s&#x2014;</i>they&#x2019;d lose their preferential rates, their pride and esteem, and the slim pay which went with them. A valued man, elevated to petty officer in one ship, would be just another Able Seaman in another. Even if they stayed aboard <i>Jester,</i> her new captain would be bringing along his own tight little clique, and would demote and replace according to his own lights.Lewrie went up the starboard gangway ladder to say his goodbyes to his waiting officers, to share a last, quick remembrance or two with them. They, at least, were officially looked after and would be going off to finer things. Though, considering the capricious whims of Admiralty, it&#x2019;d be just as stressful and worrisome to see where each might alight.Lieutenant Ralph Knolles, such an elegant, able, and cheerful young officer, sure to rise even higher and do great things. Mr. Edward Buchanon, the Sailing Master, that young-old seer and West Country mystic ...

And his built-in chorus of one, his mate LeGoff.Peter Giles, the Purser&#x2014;&#x2019;twas relief Lewrie felt when taking leave of him; that he hadn&#x2019;t yet been caught, and Lewrie implicated as well, in guilt by association in some vaulting scheme which exceeded even the jaded tolerance of a corrupt Victualling Board. <i>Was ever a dog born t&#x2019;be hung sooner or later ... !</i> Lewrie thought, glad to see the back of him!Giles, though, and his Jack-In-The-Breadroom, were as safe as houses, for he held Warrant and would continue on in her should he wish it. Mr. Crewe, her Master Gunner; Mr. Reese, her Carpenter; Mr. Paschal, the Sailmaker; Mr. Meggs, <i>Jester&#x2019;s</i> Armourer; her Cooper; and a few such others would remain aboard in the yards right into her next commission. As would Will Cony, unfortunately. Making this day even worse, making him wish he&#x2019;d never tried to promote Will to Bosun. Cony had been his &#x201c;man&#x201d; since &#x2019;81, back in the days of the siege of Yorktown, with him throughout all his adventures ... .&#x201c;Well, then,&#x201d; Lewrie said at last, from his familiar &#x201c;pulpit&#x201d; by the middle of the quarterdeck rail overlooking the waist. &#x201c;Damned if we haven&#x2019;t had a rare run of luck aboard, right, lads? Seen wonders ... <i>done</i> wonders! Met some right bastards too, but we fought &#x2018;em and beat &#x2019;em all hollow too. And now come home ... the most of us ... safe and sound.

It means he gets my loyalty, whether he deserves it or not. It means he gets my absolute best for the price of an hourly fee. It means in a world where every person has turned against him there is one person who will fight by his side for as long as there is a battle to be fought.<br>&#x2014;Victor Carl</p><p>Author of the acclaimed novels <em>Fatal Flaw</em>, <em>Bitter Truth</em>, and <em>Hostile Witness</em>, bestselling writer William Lashner crafts dark, witty, engrossing tales of suspense involving one of the most intriguing characters of modern popular fiction: Victor Carl.</p><p>A defense attorney who lives his life in shades of gray, Victor Carl fights all the right fights for all the wrong reasons. With a failing legal practice, a dead-end love life, a pile of unpaid traffic tickets, and a talent for mixing it up in tough working-class bars and sparring with obstinate cops, Victor skates on the razor's edge of legal ethics in search of the easy buck. But the one absolute in Victor's life is loyalty, especially to a client&#x2014;even if he happens to be dead. Like Joey Cheaps, a no-account who takes a knife to the throat down on the waterfront, but not before he shares with his lawyer his part in a terrible crime.</p><p>With his client murdered, Victor must search for a killer. But solving the crime means investigating the darkest spot in Joey Cheaps's misspent youth, sending Victor on a twisting journey that leads to a missing suitcase stuffed with money, photographs of a mysterious naked woman, and a Supreme Court justice with a secret to hide. And most dangerous of all, Victor steps into the crosshairs of a vengeful enemy with a past full of pain and a taste for blood.</p><p>As thrilling as it is darkly evocative, <em>Past Due</em> is a superb tale of crime and justice that takes the intrepid Victor Carl into brilliant new territory and confirms William Lashner's place among the top suspense writers of our time.</p></p><p><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author William Lashner is the author of seven suspense novels that have been published in more than a dozen languages throughout the world. A graduate of the University of Iowa's Writers' Workshop, he lives with his family outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>Lashner's latest, his fourth and longest, is another big and beautifully written saga, narrated by righteous, melancholy Philadelphia lawyer Victor Carl. Though the book is nominally a legal thriller, the Dickensian atmospherics command as much notice as the plot. A complex case connecting a recent murder to one 20 years ago counterpoints Victor's hospital visits to his dying father, who is obsessed with unburdening himself of (mostly sad) stories from his youth. It's a tribute to Lashner's skill that these yarns hold their own against the more dramatic main story line. Victor has been retained by petty wiseguy Joey Parma (known as Joey Cheaps) about an unsolved murder a generation ago. The victim was young lawyer Tommy Greeley, and Joey Cheaps was one of two perps, though he was never caught. When Joey is found near the waterfront with his throat slashed, Victor knows his duty. This involves considerable legwork and clashes with an array of sharply drawn characters; Lashner is in his element depicting this rogue's gallery, and Victor riffs philosophically on his encounters. Foremost among the shady figures is a femme fatale (improbably but appropriately) named Alura Straczynski, who sets her sights on Victor. It's a move more strategic than romantic, but no less dangerous for him. The standard coverup by men in high places waits at the end of Victor's odyssey, but this novel, like Lashner's previous ones, is all about the journey. Lashner's writing-or is it Victor's character?-gains depth and richness with every installment. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The result is a fully realized portrait of an intellectually and temperamentally complex man and at the same time an illuminating analysis of the art and craft of acting itself. Callow's enthusiasm is infectious: readers will wish to see, or see again, The Private Life of Henry VIII, Mutiny on the Bounty, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and many other movies in which Laughton appeared, including Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidda low point in his career but nonetheless a great performance, according to Callow. Laughton's odd 30-year marriage to Elsa Lanchester and his homosexuality are sympathetically discussed, along with his fortuitous associations with Bertolt Brecht, producer Paul Gregory, Robert Mitchum and other relationships not so fortuitous. This is a theater biography of the first rank, written with elegance, wit and psychological probity.

Always at odds with his unattractive face and overweight body, Laughton was troubled his whole life by feelings of guilt and inadequacy, exacerbated by his homosexuality and his unlikely 30-year marriage to Elsa Lanchester. A perfectionist when it came to working, he eventually became more and more self-absorbed. Callow's comprehensively researched and smoothly written but rarely critical work discusses virtually every film and play in which Laughton appeared and gives vintage reviews, quotes, etc. An actor himself, Callow provides an insider's insight into the life of a brilliant, troubled man.

It gives further explanation of the famous theory and its developments.</p><p>In 1921, a young Albert Einstein traveled to America to give four lectures at Princeton University, paving the way for a more complete acceptance of his theory of general relativity. These lectures are published together as <i>The Meaning of Relativity</i>, and were revised with each new edition until Einstein's death. Despite Einstein's profession that he thought without using words, his examples and descriptions of the relativistic world he perceived are clear and easy to follow. Unfortunately for nontechnical readers, his presentation requires deep diversions into mathematics often enough to break up the flow of his narrative, and they may find this rough terrain. But for the mathematically sophisticated or the devoted scientific historian, these lectures are profoundly illuminating--Einstein's bright, quiet genius shines through in the simplicity and economy of his writing. Two appendices follow the lectures: the first covers advances and experimental verifications after 1921; the second, "Relativistic Theory of the Non-Symmetric Field," was Einstein's last scientific paper. <i>The Meaning of Relativity</i> documents a revolution in progress and yields to the careful student deeper truths than those found in physics textbooks. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>Albert Einstein (1879-1955).

There he baked his favorites, like Jewish rye, cheese, and cinnamon raisin breads&#x2014;much to the delight of his wife, children, and grandchildren. He passed away in 2012. This is his second book.<b>Introduction</b><br> Elaine and Julia Greenstein, daughters of George Greenstein<br><br> Our early childhood memories are of our parents spending more time in the bakery than they did at home. After school and on weekends, we often played in the back of the bakery, drawing pictures, reading books, folding and assembling cake boxes, or running small errands. In fact, before we were even tolerated at the bakery, we folded cake boxes while parked in front of the TV set at home!<br><br> When we were tall enough to look over the counter, we started waiting on customers and helping with various jobs in the production areas. We were most often assigned jobs forming dough into pastries such as crumb buns and rugelach. We longed to get our hands on the icing and finishing equipment or to mix the batters, but the answer was always, &#x201c;no.&#x201d; Sometimes we felt like elves in a production line: standing on milk crates, assembling one tray after another of pastries from enormous batches of dough.<br><br> Even though we could eat anything we wanted in the bakery, as young girls we had a secret pleasure. We collected the glass bottles left by the workers in&nbsp;the bakery and returned them for their deposit to the deli next door. Instead of taking the cash, we traded it for a factory-produced, plastic-wrapped, squishy chocolate cupcake or pink coconut mound. We always made sure to eat the evidence before returning to our parents in the bakery. The brothers who ran the deli must have had many a chuckle after the baker&#x2019;s daughters left the deli.<br><br> It was not until college and graduate school, well away from our childhood bakery responsibilities, that we started to appreciate the bakery treats and welcomed the care packages sent from home. Our circle of friends really appreciated them, too! One of us, Julia, remembers her PhD advisor claiming that she added the benefits of these care packages to her recommendation letters. Who knows how much of her career was based on the contents of the packages?<br><br> Once we moved away from home, we began&nbsp;to become bakers in our own right, finally allowed to take on mixing and decorating duties outside of the bakery. Our dad showed great joy and pride seeing our results. When dividing jobs for our annual Thanksgiving family meal, there was always a negotiation because everyone wanted to make the desserts. Even though our father was always ready with specific comments on the quality of the results, it did not stop the competitive baking, which has continued with the next generation of bakers in our family.<br><br> George began this book about 15 years ago, after <i>Secrets of a Jewish Baker</i> was published. He worked on it off and on, but for one reason or another, it never made it to publication. George passed away on July 20, 2012. The next day, our family gathered at our mother&#x2019;s house. We all kept busy in our own ways to deal with our grief. Some of us cooked, while others started going through papers. When Paul, Julia&#x2019;s husband, found this manuscript, we, Julia and Elaine, and his grandson, Isaac, made a pact to get the book published. The three of us are the ones who always plan the meals and get excited over food. (It is a good thing we each have our own kitchen. We all inherited being the boss from our dad.) Julia has an amazing ability to create spectacular dinners for large numbers of guests, and Elaine dallied with being a pastry chef. Isaac caught the bug early, astounding us all with his amazing bread and pastries.<br><br> Finishing our dad&#x2019;s project has been a way to honor and mourn him. Sometimes as Elaine tested recipes, the image of him dressed in his white pants and apron, his big, floury hands gripping a huge rolling pin, rolling massive lumps of dough, kept her company in her kitchen. For Julia, going through the recipes and trying to see his vision brought back the hours Dad spent in his consistent search for the perfect baked goods, both at his own bakery and in our family travels. Isaac remembered standing on a high stool to see above the counter, watching his grandfather teach him how to roll rugelach, a family favorite. We hope this recipe, as well as the others in the book, bring as much joy and sweetness to your life as our dad did to ours.<br> <b>Apricot Rugelach</b><br> The rugelach we made in the bakery does not fit in any of the chapters. But we love it so much we are including it. The last project our dad did every Sunday would be to roll out a huge sheet of the dough, and we would roll up each pastry. It seemed like it took forever to complete. Don&#x2019;t worry&#x2014;the recipe below does not make the amount we made in the bakery.<br><br> <b>Rugelach Dough</b><br> 12 ounces (340 grams) cream cheese, <br> at room temperature<br> 2 cups (8.5 ounces / 241 grams) unbleached all-purpose flour<br> 1 cup (8 ounces / 227 grams) cake flour<br> 1 1&#x2044;2 cups (12 ounces / 340 grams) unsalted butter, cut into 1&#x2044;2-inch dice<br> 1&#x2044;3 cup (2.3 ounces / 65 grams) sugar<br> 1&#x2044;4 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1&#x2044;4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 eggs<br> 1&#x2044;2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br><b><br> Apricot Filling</b><br> 1 cup (10.5 ounces / 298 grams) <br> Apricot Butter (page 33)<br> 1 1&#x2044;2 cups (9 ounces / 255 grams) raisins, preferably golden<br> 2 cups (8 ounces / 227 grams) walnuts, chopped, preferably toasted (page 31)<br> 1 1&#x2044;2 cups (5.4 ounces / 120 grams) cake crumbs (see page 42) or bread crumbs, preferably fresh<br> 1 cup (7.2 ounces / 200 grams) Cinnamon Sugar (page 40), half reserved for topping<br> 1&#x2044;4 cup (2 ounces / 57 grams) unsalted butter, melted<br><br> Line a 12 by 18-inch sheet pan with parchment paper or greased waxed paper. Flour a second 12&nbsp;x 18-inch baking pan.<br><br> To make the dough, in the mixing bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a flat paddle, combine the cream cheese, all-purpose and cake flours, butter, sugar, baking powder, salt, eggs, and vanilla. Pulse with the on/off switch until blended, making sure that the flour does not fly out of the bowl. Mix at low speed until the dough becomes smooth. It&#x2019;s okay if small lumps of butter remain; they will be absorbed into the dough as it is rolled out.<br><br> Tip the dough out onto the floured baking pan and press out or roll until the dough is level and fills the entire pan. Cover with parchment paper or plastic wrap. Refrigerate for several hours or overnight, until well chilled. Rugelach are best rolled while partially chilled.<br> Cut the dough in half and work with one part at a time, keeping the other half refrigerated or frozen until ready to use. (This dough freezes well, tightly wrapped, for up to several months. It is best when thawed slowly in the refrigerator overnight.) Allow the dough to rest until soft enough to roll: fingertips pressed into the dough will leave an indentation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Roll the dough out on a heavily floured surface into a 1&#x2044;2-inch-thick rectangle measuring about 20 by 12 inches. Lift the dough and dust with additional flour underneath. This dough tends to stick to the surface when fully rolled out. Brush away any excess flour from the top.<br><br> Spread a generous layer of apricot butter over the entire dough, from edge to edge. Cover heavily with layers of half of the raisins, half of the walnuts, half of the cake crumbs, and half of the cinnamon sugar. Press down with your hands or roll lightly to make the filling adhere. Roll the pastry in both length and width until it is about 1&#x2044;8-inch-thick measuring about 36 by 20&nbsp;inches. The filling will be compressed right into the dough; it will be almost translucent.<br><br> Trim the edges with a 4-inch wheel or pizza cutter, or a sharp knife. Using a thumb or a ruler as a gauge, cut strips along the short side of the rectangle about 1 inch wide. This should yield 30 or more strips. Beginning at the bottom left, roll the strip until it is about 1 inch high, like a snail shell. Tear the pastry free and roll over a half turn so the seam is centered on the bottom. Repeat with the remainder of the first strip, lining up the finished rugelach on the work surface in rows, letting them touch each other. Scrape or brush any crumbs aside with a bench knife, or brush as you work. When you arrive at the end of a strip, attach it to the bottom of the next row by pressing a 1&#x2044;2-inch edge onto the strip. Continue rolling as if it is all one piece.<br> &nbsp;<br> Continue rolling until all of the dough has been used. Brush the tops with melted butter.

The ways in which we live our rich and varied lives correspond - almost eerily so - to the ways in which the Greeks and Romans lived theirs. Whether we are eating and drinking, bathing or exercising or making love, pondering, admiring or enquiring, our habits of thought and action, our diversions and concentrations recreate theirs. It is as though the 1500 years after the fall of Rome had been time out from traditional ways of being human. This eye-opening book makes us look afresh at who we are and how we got here. Full Circle is not only wonderfully witty and brilliantly astute, but also profound and often disquieting. Ferdinand Mount effortlessly peels back 2000 years of history to show how much we are like the ancients, how in ways both trivial and crucial we are them and they are us.</p><p>Ferdinand Mount was born in 1939. For many years he was a columnist at the Spectator and then the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Times.

This book offers a fully illustrated, highly accessible introduction to an important aspect of that culture&#x2014;the scientific achievements of medieval Islam.</p><p>Howard Turner opens with a historical overview of the spread of Islamic civilization from the Arabian peninsula eastward to India and westward across northern Africa into Spain. He describes how a passion for knowledge led the Muslims during their centuries of empire-building to assimilate and expand the scientific knowledge of older cultures, including those of Greece, India, and China. He explores medieval Islamic accomplishments in cosmology, mathematics, astronomy, astrology, geography, medicine, natural sciences, alchemy, and optics. He also indicates the ways in which Muslim scientific achievement influenced the advance of science in the Western world from the Renaissance to the modern era. This survey of historic Muslim scientific achievements offers students and general readers a window into one of the world's great cultures, one which is experiencing a remarkable resurgence as a religious, political, and social force in our own time.</p></p><p>Howard R. Turner is a documentary and educational film and television writer who served as Curator for Science for the major traveling exhibition "The Heritage of Islam, 1982&#x2013;1983."&#34;This book could well become the best means to introduce people to Islam&#39;s contributions to science, medicine, and philosophy....

Until she found out the mysterious stolen box had been taken from Elani Street, where the mages and charlatans mingled, and it was sometimes hard to tell the difference between the two. And since the box was ancient, without a keyhole, and held tremendous darkness inside, Kaylin knew unknown forces were again playing with her destiny&#x2014;and her life....<br><br></p><p><p>New York Times bestselling author Michelle Sagara writes as both Michelle Sagara and Michelle West; she is also published as Michelle Sagara West. She lives in Toronto with her long-suffering husband and her two children, and to her regret has no dogs.<br>She can be found @msagara on Twitter or http://msagarawest.wordpress.com</p><br><br>Private Kaylin Neya studied the duty roster, and given how little she studied anything that wasn't somehow involved with a corpse, this said something.<br><br>The official roster was like a dartboard, except that people threw pencils at it instead. Sometimes they hit a bull's-eye anyway. Lined up in columns by day, and color-coded for the more moronic&#x2014;or hungover&#x2014;by district, it told the various members of the branch of law enforcement known as the Hawks where, exactly, they were meant to either find trouble or stay out of it. Kaylin could easily make out her name, although some clod with lousy aim had managed to make a giant hole in it.<br><br>If it was true that the roster could never make everyone happy, it was somehow <i>also </i>true that it could make everyone <i>un</i>happy. Sergeant Marcus Kassan, in charge of assigning duties on a monthly basis, had a strong sense of fairness; if someone was going to suffer, everyone might as well keep them company.<br><br>As the Hawks' <i>only </i>Leontine officer&#x2014;in fact, the only Leontine to <i>be </i>an officer of the Halls of Law&#x2014;he presided over the men and women under his command with a hooded set of fangs in a face that was fur, large eyes and peaked ears&#x2014;in that order. He also boasted a set of claws that made daggers superfluous and did a good job against swords, as well.<br><br>Kaylin had no pencil with which to puncture the paper, or she'd have thrown more at it than liberal curses.<br><br>Swearing at one's assignment wasn't unusual in the office; as far as office pastimes went, it was one that most of the Hawks indulged in. Kaylin's partner, Corporal Severn Handred, looked easily over her shoulder, but waited until she turned to raise a dark brow in her general direction. That brow was bisected by a slender, white line, a scar that didn't so much mar his face as hint at secret histories.<br><br>Secret, at least, to Kaylin; she hadn't seen him take that one.<br><br>"What will you be missing?" he asked, when her impressive spate of cursing&#x2014;in four official languages&#x2014;had died down enough that he could be heard without shouting. Severn rarely raised his voice.<br><br>"Game," she said curtly. "Ball," she added.<br><br>"Playing?"<br><br>She grimaced. "Betting." Which, for Kaylin, was synonymous with <i>watching</i>.<br><br>"Figures. Who were you betting on?"<br><br>She shrugged. "Sharks."<br><br>"So you'll save some money."<br><br>This caused an entirely different spate of swearing, and she punctuated this by punching his shoulder, which he thoughtfully turned in her direction. "You'd be betting on the Tigers, I suppose?"<br><br>"Already have," he replied. "Our shift?" He glanced at the window. It told the time. Literally. Mages had been allowed to go mad when they'd been asked to encourage punctuality, and it showed. The urge to tell the window to shut the hell up came and went several times a day.<br><br>The fact that mages had been allowed to perform the spell or series of spells seemed almost a direct criticism of Kaylin, who wasn't exactly punctual on the best of days.<br><br>"Private Neya and Corporal Handred, report to the Quartermaster before active duty." Some sweet young voice had been used to capture the words. Kaylin seriously wanted to meet the person behind it. And was pretty sure the person behind it seriously didn't want to meet her.<br><br>"Quartermaster?" Severn said, with the barest hint of a sympathetic grimace.<br><br>Kaylin said, "Can I break the window first?"<br><br>"Won't help. He's probably responsible for having the glass replaced, and you're in enough trouble with him as is."<br><br>It was true. She had barely managed to crawl up the ladder from thing-scraped-off-the-bottom-of-a-shoe-after-a-dog-fight in the unspoken ranks the Quartermaster gave the Hawks; she was now merely in the person-I-can't-see category, which was a distinct improvement, although it usually meant she was the last to get kitted out. The Quartermaster was officious enough, however, to make last and late two entirely different domains&#x2014;if only, in Kaylin's case, by seconds.<br><br>"It was just a stupid dress," she muttered. "<i>One </i>dress, and I'm in the doghouse."<br><br>"I doubt it. You know how much he loves those dogs."<br><br>"Yeah. A lot more than he likes the rest of us."<br><br>"It was an <i>expensive </i>dress, Kaylin."<br><br>"I didn't choose it!"<br><br>"No. But you did give it back with a few bloodstains, a dozen knife tears, and about a pound less fabric."<br><br>"It's not like it could have been used by anyone else&#x2014;"<br><br>"Not in that condition, no. And," he added, lifting a hand, "I'm not the Quartermaster, I didn't have to haggle with the Seamstresses Guild, and I don't really care."<br><br>"Yeah, but his life doesn't depend on me, so he doesn't have to listen to me whine."<br><br>Severn chuckled. "No. Your career depends on him, however. Good job, Kaylin."<br><br>They walked down the long hall that led to Marcus's desk, which just happened to be situated so that it crossed almost any indoor path a Hawk could take in the line of duty. He liked to keep an eye on things. Or a claw across the throat, as the Leontine saying went.<br><br>As the Hawks' sergeant, assignments came from him, and reports&#x2014;which involved the paperwork he so hated&#x2014;went to him. Caitlin, his assistant, and for all purposes, his second in command, was the one who would actually <i>read </i>the submissions, and she wisely chose to pass on only those that she felt were important. The rest, she fudged.<br><br>And since the Festival season was, as of two days past, officially over, most of those reports involved a lot of cleanup, a lot of official fines&#x2014;which helped the coffers of the Halls of Law immensely&#x2014;and a lot of petty bickering, which would be referred to the unofficial courts in the various racial enclaves for mediation.<br><br>Ceding that bickering to the racial courts, rather than the Imperial Courts, took <i>more </i>paperwork. But the Emperor was short on time and very, very short on patience, so only cases of real import&#x2014;or those that involved the Elantran nobil-ity&#x2014;ever went to him directly. Given that he was Immortal, being a dragon and all, this struck Kaylin as unfair. After all, he <i>had </i>forever.<br><br>"Lord Kaylin," Marcus said, as they approached his desk. The title, granted her by the Lord of the Barrani High Court, caused a round of snickers and an unfortunate echo in the office that set Kaylin's teeth on edge. The deep sarcasm that only a Leontine throat could produce didn't help much. "So good of you to join us."<br><br>She snapped him a salute&#x2014;which, given his rank didn't demand it, was only meant to annoy&#x2014;and stood at attention in front of his desk. Severn's short sigh, she ignored; he offered Marcus neither of these gestures.<br><br>"There's been a slight change in your beat today."<br><br>The official roster changed at the blink of an eye. A Leon-tine eye, with its golden iris. "You're to go to Elani Street," he told them.<br><br>"What, mage central?"<br><br>"Or Charlatan central, if you prefer," Marcus snapped back. Elani Street was both. There was the real stuff, if you weren't naive and you knew what to look for, and then there was love potion number nine, and tell your fortune, and meet the right mate, all of which booths&#x2014;usually with much finer names&#x2014;saw a steady stream of traffic, day in and day out.<br><br>Kaylin was always torn between contempt for the people who had such blind dreams and contempt for the people who could exploit them so callously. Elani Street was not her favorite street, mostly because she couldn't decide which of the two she wanted to strangle more.<br><br>She flipped an invisible coin. It landed, after a moment in the mental ether, on the side of people who made money, rather than people who lost it.<br><br>"Who's fleecing people this time?" Kaylin muttered. "It's only two days past Festival&#x2014;you'd think people would be tired enough to give it a rest. Or," she added darkly, "in jail."<br><br>"Many are both," Marcus replied, and something in his tone made her give up her sullen and almost perfect stance to lean slightly into the desk. Slightly was safe; he still hadn't cleared half the paperwork the Festival produced annually, and knocking any of the less than meticulous piles over was&#x2014;well, the furrows in the desk didn't get there by magic.<br><br>"What's happened?"<br><br>"There's been a disturbance," he replied. "I believe you know the shop. Evanton's. You may have given him some business over the years."<br><br>She knew the shop; she had had her knives enchanted there so that they left their sheaths without a sound. Teela had been the Hawk who had both introduced her to Evan-ton and also made clear to Evanton that anything he offered <i>for money </i>had better damn well work. Given that Teela was one of a dozen or so Barrani&#x2014;also all Hawks&#x2014;who had made their pledge of allegiance to the Imperial Halls of Law, her word tended to carry weight. After all, she was, like the dragon Emperor and the rest of her kind, immortal&#x2014;and the Barrani loved nothing better than a grudge, at least judging by the way they held on to the damn things so tightly. Startlingly beautiful to the eye, they were cold as crackling ice to the ear, and their tall, slender bodies radiated that I-can-kill-you-before-you-can-blink confidence that was, in fact, no act.<br><br>Evanton, to his credit, had been neither offended nor frightened. In fact, his first words had been, "Yes, yes, I know the drill, Officer." And his second: "You're on the young side for a Hawk. So take my advice, for what it's worth. You should pay more attention to the company you keep. People will judge you by it, mark my words."<br><br>He generally had a lot of words he wanted marked.<br><br>Which had caused Teela to grimace. And Tain, her beat partner, to laugh.<br><br>As for the enchantment, he'd approved of it. "Most people who come here want something to make them look prettier," he'd said, with obvious contempt. "Or younger. Or smarter. This, <i>this </i>is practical."<br><br>She had never asked Evanton if he had ever belonged to the Imperial Order of Mages; there wasn't much point. If he had, he'd managed to get out the unusual way&#x2014;he wasn't in a coffin. Although to Kaylin's youthful eye, he looked as if he should have been. His hair was the color of blinding light off still water, and his skin was like wrinkled leather; he was almost skeletal, and his work&#x2014;or so he said&#x2014;demanded so much attention he was continuously bent over in a stoop. She had been certain, the first time she saw him, that he would break if she forced him to straighten up.<br><br>But still...she liked him. So she frowned. "What kind of a disturbance?"<br><br>"That, I think, is what you're there to ascertain." He paused. "Are you waiting for something?"<br><br>"No, sir."<br><br>"Good. Get lost."<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>"Corporal?"<br><br>Severn nodded.<br><br>"Make sure that she understands that 'get lost' in this case isn't literal."<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>"What I want to know," Private Kaylin Neya said, not quite stomping her feet as she marched down the streets, "is why no one calls <i>you </i>Lord Severn."<br><br>The corporal&#x2014;which rank still annoyed Kaylin, and yes, she knew it was petty&#x2014;shrugged. "Because it doesn't bother <i>me,</i>" he replied.<br><br>"It didn't bother me when the Barrani called me Lord Kaylin," she said sourly.<br><br>He laughed. He kept an easy pace with her march, given the difference in the length of their strides, and her mood&#x2014; which could charitably be described as not very good&#x2014; seemed to cheer him immensely.<br><br>"What's so funny?"<br><br>"It bothered you enough to cause you to point out that no one called Teela Lord."<br><br>She waved a hand dismissively. "It wasn't the Barrani," she insisted. "But when Marcus started&#x2014;"<br><br>"The entire office, you mean?"<br><br>"The entire office follows Marcus's lead, except when he's chewing through his desk." Which was only partly a figurative description of an angry Leontine officer. Leontine fur, when it stood on end, was impressive; Leontine jaws, massive, boasted teeth that were easily capable of rendering most throats not quite useful for things like breathing&#x2014;but most of the danger they could offer came from their massive, and usually sheathed, claws.<br><br>Marcus's desk was a testament to how often he lost his temper.<br><br>"If you give it a few days," Severn told her, "it'll pass."<br><br>She snorted. "Sanabalis started it."<br><br>"Lord Sanabalis."<br><br>"That's not what I call him."<br><br>"It is, however, what everyone <i>else </i>calls him, and what you'd like to call him at the moment would be...ill advised. You're his student, he has graciously agreed to continue to tutor you, and you both know that your career depends on whether or not he decides to actually <i>pass </i>you." He didn't add that in this case career and life were the same thing. He didn't need to. Kaylin had a magic that not even the most august of the Imperial scholars understood, and if it had been a weak magic, it wouldn't have mattered&#x2014;much. But it was strong enough to withstand the full breath of a dragon in his true form. Strong enough to make a hole in a thick stone wall that was wider across than Severn. Strong enough to heal the dying.<br><br>And the Emperor was in possession of all these facts, and more. Kaylin's glance strayed a moment to her arms; the length of her sleeves all but hid the dark marks that were tattooed there, in whirls and strokes, as if she were parchment, and they were the scattered telling of a story that was ancient before history began.<br><br></p><h2>Eliza and the Dragonfly: A Nature Book for Kids About Insect Life Cycles</h2><p>Teachers and parents! This book is a rare find, well deserving of the prestigious award from CBC-NSTA. The science about dragonflies is perfectly integrated into a story in which the remarkable metamorphosis of a dragonfly from a mucky nymph (Eeeewww, says Eliza) to a beautiful winged creature (Magnificent! says Aunt Doris) is a metaphor for the magic of how Eliza, too, grows up. Teachers will find it useful primarily in an elementary science unit on insects, life cycles and habitats, but also in for language arts lessons in theme, symbolism, and metaphor. The watercolor illustrations are rich, whimsical, and fun. There are two pages of additional science in the back. This is an exceptional example of creative non-fiction writing.</p><p>When Susie Caldwell Rinehart is not busy mucking about in the pond watching dragonflies, she is a teacher and writer. Born in Toronto, Canada, she has degrees in English and Science. Susie believes that the best kind of learning takes place on the edge between science and art. <i>Eliza and the Dragonfly</i> is her first children's book. Susie lives in Vershire, Vermont with her husband Kurt, and their son Cole. AUTORBIO: (Illustrator) It seems that Anisa Claire Hovemann has always been an artist. As a three year-old, she would form remarkably lifelike dinosaurs out of her colorful playdough. At the Waldorf elementary school she attended, her artistic tendencies fit naturally into the curriculum. She is currently a senior at the Maryland Institute College of Art, pursuing a degree in fine arts-but took off a semester to finish this project, her first illustrated book. Her research included spending quite a bit of time at "Dragonfly Pond" near her home in Nevada City, California"Magnificent!

At the same time, while preparing for the Sandman 10th anniversary, he met Yoshitaka Amano, his artist for the 11th Sandman book. Amano is the famed designer of the <i>Final Fantasy</i> game series. The product of Gaiman's immersion in Japanese art, culture, and history, <i>Sandman: Dream Hunters</i> is a classic Japanese tale (adapted from "The Fox, the Monk, and the Mikado of All Night's Dreaming") that he has subtly morphed into his Sandman universe. <p> Like most fables, the story begins with a wager between two jealous animals, a fox and a badger: which of them can drive a young monk from his solitary temple? The winner will make the temple into a new fox or badger home. But as the fox adopts the form of a woman to woo the monk from his hermitage, she falls in love with him. Meanwhile, in far away Kyoto, the wealthy Master of Yin-Yang, the <i>onmyoji</i>, is plagued by his fears and seeks tranquility in his command of sorcery. He learns of the monk and his inner peace; he dispatches demons to plague the monk in his dreams and eventually kill him to bring his peace to the onmyoji. The fox overhears the demons on their way to the monk and begins her struggle to save the man whom at first she so envied.</p><p> <i>Dream Hunters</i> is a beautiful package. From the ink-brush painted endpapers to the luminous page layouts--including Amano's gate-fold painting of Morpheus in a sea of reds, oranges, and violets--this book has been crafted for a sensuous reading experience. Gaiman has developed as a prose stylist in the last several years with novels and stories such as <i>Neverwhere</i> and <i>Stardust</i>, and his narrative rings with a sense of timelessness and magic that gently sustains this adult fairy tale. The only disappointment here is that the book is so brief. One could imagine this creative team being even better suited to a longer story of more epic proportions. On the final page of <i>Dream Hunters</i>, in fact, Amano suggest that he will collaborate further with Mr. Gaiman in the future. Readers of <i>Dream Hunters</i> will hope that Amano's dream comes true. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Gaiman's enormously successful Sandman monthly comic book (1989-96), which won eight Eisner awards in a row for comic book excellence, has been collected in a series of equally successful graphic novels. This book, representing Gaiman's first Sandman story in three years, retells Japanese folk tale "The Fox, the Monk, and the Mikado of All Night's Dreaming." The central characters are the Fox and the Monk, and the Sandman only plays a peripheral role. The book isn't really a graphic novel, as there are roughly 60 pages of typed prose and 60 pages of illustrations. It is an illustrated novel that remains true to both the Japanese tale and the motifs that made the Sandman series so popular. The illustrations are reminiscent of Japanese brush work and gently push the text along. Not the best first Sandman purchase for any library, this book is a necessary purchase if your patrons are Sandman readers, or if your world folk tales collection needs strengthening--Stephen Weiner, Maynard P.L., MA <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Corporations Are People Too: (And They Should Act Like It)</h2><p><b>Why we&#x2019;re better off treating corporations as people under the law&#x2014;and making them behave like citizens</b><br><br> Are corporations people? The U.S. Supreme Court launched a heated debate when it ruled in <i>Citizens United </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that corporations can claim the same free speech rights as humans. Should they be able to claim rights of free speech, religious conscience, and due process? Kent Greenfield provides an answer: Sometimes.<br> &nbsp;<br> With an analysis sure to challenge the assumptions of both progressives and conservatives, Greenfield explores corporations&#x2019; claims to constitutional rights and the foundational conflicts about their obligations in society and concludes that a blanket opposition to corporate personhood is misguided, since it is consistent with both the purpose of corporations and the Constitution itself that corporations can claim rights at least some of the time. The problem with <i>Citizens United</i> is not that corporations have a right to speak, but for whom they speak. The solution is not to end corporate personhood but to require corporations to act more like citizens.</p><p><b>Kent Greenfield</b> is a law professor at Boston College, a former Supreme Court clerk, and an expert in constitutional and corporate law. His work has been featured in the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, the <i>Atlantic</i>, and on CNN."A must read. Greenfield is one of the very few law professors in America with a serious background in both constitutional and corporate law, and his double expertise is reflected in almost every chapter."&#x2014;Eric Segall, <i>Dorf on Law</i><br>"A subtle, creative and intellectually brave assessment of the nature of corporate personhood and the legal and policy results&#x2014;constitutional and otherwise-- that follow from that assessment. Greenfield offers thoughtful and often original views on topics ranging from the degree of First Amendment protection that corporations should receive to the nature of corporate behavior that shareholders and the broader public should come to expect."&#x2014;Floyd Abrams, author of <i>The Soul of the First Amendment </i><br>&#x201c;In a lively and very readable book, Greenfield makes the case that corporations must have many, if not all, the&nbsp; constitutional rights that people have.&#x201d;&#x2014; Paul Smith, Georgetown University Law Center<br>&#x201c;Professor Kent Greenfield has written a brilliant book on the role of corporations in American democracy. Greenfield gets us past the discussion of whether corporations should be regarded as persons and focuses on how they should be treated under the law. The book is provocative, original, and engaging and sure to be essential reading in grappling with the role of corporations in our political system.&#x201d;&#x2014;Erwin Chemerinsky, Dean and Jesse H.

Watson, who shared the Nobel Prize for having revealed the structure of DNA&#x2014;a personal account of the making of a scientist. In <i>Avoid Boring People,</i> the man who discovered &#x201c;the secret of life&#x201d; shares the less revolutionary secrets he has found to getting along and getting ahead in a competitive world.<br><br>Recounting the years of his own formation&#x2014;from his father&#x2019;s birding lessons to the political cat&#x2019;s cradle of professorship at Harvard&#x2014;Watson illuminates the progress of an exemplary scientific life, both his own pursuit of knowledge and how he learns to nurture fledgling scientists. Each phase of his experience yields a wealth of age-specific practical advice. For instance, when young, never be the brightest person in the room or bring more than one date on a ski trip; later in life, always accept with grace when your request for funding is denied, and--for goodness&#x2019; sake--don&#x2019;t dye your hair. There are precepts that few others would find occasion to heed (expect to gain weight after you win your Nobel Prize, as everyone will invite you to dinner) and many more with broader application (do not succumb to the seductions of golf if you intend to stay young professionally). And whatever the season or the occasion: avoid boring people.<br><br>A true believer in the intellectual promise of youth, Watson offers specific pointers to beginning scientists about choosing the projects that will shape their careers, the supreme importance of collegiality, and dealing with competitors within the same institution, even one who is a former mentor. Finally he addresses himself to the role and needs of science at large universities in the context of discussing the unceremonious departure of Harvard's president Larry Summers and the search for his successor.<br><br>Scorning political correctness, this irreverent romp through Watson&#x2019;s life and learning is an indispensable guide to anyone plotting a career in science (or most anything else), a primer addressed both to the next generation and those who are entrusted with their minds.</p><p>James D. Watson was director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York from 1968 to 1993 and is now its chancellor. He was the first director of the National Center for Human Genome Research of the National Institutes of Health from 1989 to 1992. A member of the National Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society, he has received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the National Medal of Science, and, with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962.<b>Remembered Lessons from Childhood on Chicago's South Side</b><br><b>1. Avoid fighting bigger boys or dogs</b><br><br>As a child I lived with being punier than other boys in class. The only consolation was my parents' empathy&#x2014;they encouraged constant trips to the local drugstore for chocolate milk shakes to fatten me up. The shakes made me happy, but still all through grammar school other kids shoved me around. At first I responded with my fists, but soon I realized that being called a sissy was a better fate than being beaten up. It was easier to cross to the other side of the street than come face-to-face with loitering menaces with a nose for my fear. Likewise, I was no match for barking dogs, particularly ones I had provoked by climbing over fences into their domains. Spotting a rare bird is never worth the bite of a cur. Once bitten by a German shepherd, I knew that I preferred cats, even if they are bird-killers. Life is long enough for more than one chance at a rare bird.<br><b>2. Put lots of spin on balls</b><br><br>I long wanted to be part of the softball games played on the big vacant lot across Seventy-ninth Street. At first my only way to join in was to field foul balls. Then I learned how to put spin on underhanded pitches that kept even the better batters from routinely smacking line drives through holes in the outfield. From then on I felt much less an outsider on Saturday mornings. The spins that came from similarly slicing ping-pong serves helped make me a good player well before my arms got long enough to reach near the net of our family&#x2019;s basement table.<br><b>3. Never accept dares that put your life at risk</b><br><br>Seeing classmates dash across a street to beat a coming car filled me with more horror than envy of their bravado. When I rode my bike three miles to the Museum of Science and Industry, I knew my constantly worrying mother would have preferred my taking the streetcar. But by being cautious&#x2014;going down as many alleys as possible and never taking my hands off the handlebars when a car was passing&#x2014;I was never really putting my life at significant risk. Likewise, in climbing up and over the branches of neighborhood trees or hoisting myself up along gutters to the roofs of one-story garages, I may have been risking a broken leg but not a fatal fall. The possibility of plunging more than ten feet never seemed worth the thrill of being high up.<br><b>4. Accept only advice that comes from experience as opposed to revelation</b><br><br>Listening to my elders just because they were older was not the way I grew up. Preadolescent exposure to my relatives&#x2019; views that the New Deal would bankrupt the United States and that Hitler would cease being an aggressor after conquering England left me with no illusions that adults are less likely than children to utter nonsense. For the most part, my parents tried to provide rational explanations for why I should think a certain way or do a certain thing. So I was convinced by my mother&#x2019;s advice that I wear rubbers on rainy days so as not to ruin my leather soles. At the same time, I rejected her no less often heard argument that sodden feet led to colds.<br><br>By then I was conditioned to accept my father&#x2019;s disdain for any explanations that went beyond the laws of reason and science. Astrology had to be bunk until someone could demonstrate in a verifiable way that the arrangement of the stars and planets affected the course of individual lives. Equally improbable to Dad was the idea of a supreme being, the widespread belief in whose existence was in no way subject to observation or experimentation. It is no coincidence that so many religious beliefs date back to times when no science could possibly have accounted satisfactorily for many of the natural phenomena inspiring scripture and myths.<br><b>5. Hypocrisy in search of social acceptance erodes</b> <b>your self-respect</b><br><br>My parents and most of their neighbors had nothing bonding them together but Horace Mann Grammar School. Mother, with an outgoing and generous personality, naturally rose to be president of the PTA. But except for a keen interest in baseball, Dad had nothing in common with his fellow fathers. That love, however, seldom drew him into the backyards of neighbors, where frequent blasts at the New Deal and occasional anti-Semitic jokes were insufferable for Dad, whose favorite radio personality besides Franklin Roosevelt was the Jewish intellectual Clifton Fadiman. He knew enough to avoid occasions where polite silence in response to repulsive remarks could be construed as acquiescence in their awfulness.<br><b>6. Never be flippant with teachers</b><br><br>My parents made it clear that I should never display even the slightest disrespect to individuals who had the power to let me skip a half grade or move into more challenging classes. While it was all right for me to know more about a topic than my sixth-grade teacher had ever learned, questioning her facts could only lead to trouble.Until one has cleared high school there is little to be gained by questioning what your teacher wants you to learn. Better to memorize obligingly their pet facts and get perfect grades. Save flights of rebellion for when authority does not have you by the throat.<br><b>7. When intellectually panicking, get help quickly</b><br><br>Occasionally I found myself nervously distraught, unable to repeat an algebraic trick I had learned the previous day. I never hesitated in such circumstances to turn to a classmate for help. Better for one of them to know my inadequacies than not to be able to go on to the next problem. &#x201c;Do it yourself or you&#x2019;ll never learn&#x201d; may have some validity, but fail to get it done and you&#x2019;ll go nowhere. Even more frequently I was unable to express myself in words and habitually procrastinated with writing assignments. It was only with my mother&#x2019;s last-minute help that I punctually submitted a well-written eighth-grade paper on the history of Chicago. Of much greater importance was Mother&#x2019;s later insistence that she edit every word of my scholarship essay to the University of Chicago. I accepted her extensive editing with little guilt, then or since.<br><b>8. Find a young hero to emulate</b><br><br>On one of our regular Friday night visits to the Seventy-third Street public library, my father encouraged me to borrow Paul de Kruif&#x2019;s celebrated 1926 book, <i>Microbe Hunters</i>. In it were fascinating stories of how infectious diseases were being conquered by scientists who went after bad germs with the same tenacity as Sherlock Holmes pursuing the evil Dr. Moriarty. Some months later I brought home <i>Arrowsmith</i>, in which Sinclair Lewis, helped by Paul de Kruif as expert consultant, relates the never-realized hope of his hero to save victims from cholera by treating them with bacteria-killing viruses. The protagonist&#x2019;s youth gripped me and made me realize that science could be like baseball: a young man&#x2019;s game whose stars made their mark in their early twenties.<br><br>Also encouraging me to aim high was my not-too-distant cousin Orson Welles, whose grandmother was a Watson. Though we never met, he also had an Illinois background and after being effectively orphaned was partly raised by my father&#x2019;s uncle, the celebrated Chicago artist Dudley Crafts Watson. Always turned out with much panache, including a pince-nez, Dudley relished telling his nephew&#x2019;s family of Orson&#x2019;s triumphs, which began when he was a child actor in the Todd School. Orson&#x2019;s daring was what appealed to me most, from his famous <i>War of the Worlds</i> radio hoax to his groundbreaking feature <i>Citizen Kane</i>. A scientist&#x2019;s hero need not be a microbiologist, let alone a baseball player.</p><h2>Saint Francis of Assisi</h2><p>This is Chesterton&#x2019;s touching take on one of the most beloved and celebrated saints in the Christian calendar, Saint Francis of Assini. Contrasting Francis&#x2019;s principled asceticism and tender sentiments with the arcane savagery of the Middle Ages, Chesterton reveals the extent to which Francis&#x2019; love of women and animal kind made him a thinker and Christian practitioner that was truly ahead of his time.</p><p>There are certainly many studies of Saint Francis of Assisi that an interested reader might find and many of them immensely praiseworthy. But in reading G.K. Chesterton on Francis, you get two glories for one: first is an enlightening study of this most beloved of Christian saints and second is Chesterton himself, one of the great Christian writers of the 20th century, who converted to Roman Catholicism in 1922 because, it has been said, "only the Roman Church could produce a St. Francis of Assisi." Published shortly after his conversion, Chesterton wrote this book in part to reclaim Francis for the church. There are always those who want to claim Francis for their cause, Chesterton recognized, who also fail to understand the spiritual and intellectual ground upon which he stands. Chesterton would return Francis to Christ. As he summarizes, "however wild and romantic his gyrations might appear to many, [Francis] always hung on to reason by one invisible and indestructible hair.... The great saint was sane.... He was not a mere eccentric because he was always turning towards the center and heart of the maze; he took the queerest and most zigzag shortcuts through the wood, but he was always going home." <p> As one editor of Chesterton's puts it, "of St. Francis he might have said what he said about Blake: 'We always feel that he is saying something very plain and emphatic even when we have not the wildest notion of what it is.'" <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p>Francis of Assisi is, after Mary of Nazareth, the greatest saint in the Christian calendar, and one of the most influential men in the whole of human history. By universal acclaim, this biography by G. K. Chesterton is considered the best appreciation of Francis's life--the one that gets to the heart of the matter.<p></p><p>For Chesterton, Francis is a great paradoxical figure, a man who loved women but vowed himself to chastity; an artist who loved the pleasures of the natural world as few have loved them, but vowed himself to the most austere poverty, stripping himself naked in the public square so all could see that he had renounced his worldly goods; a clown who stood on his head in order to see the world aright. Chesterton gives us Francis in his world-the riotously colorful world of the High Middle Ages, a world with more pageantry and romance than we have seen before or since. Here is the Francis who tried to end the Crusades by talking to the Saracens, and who interceded with the emperor on behalf of the birds. Here is the Francis who inspired a revolution in art that began with Giotto and a revolution in poetry that began with Dante. Here is the Francis who prayed and danced with pagan abandon, who talked to animals, who invented the creche.</p></p><h2>The Mountain: My Time on Everest</h2><p>In national bestseller <i>The Mountain</i>, world-renowned climber and bestselling author Ed Viesturs and cowriter David Roberts paint a vivid portrait of obsession, dedication, and human achievement in a true love letter to the world&#x2019;s highest peak.<br><br>In <i>The Mountain</i>, veteran world-class climber and bestselling author Ed Viesturs&#x2014;the only American to have climbed all fourteen of the world&#x2019;s 8,000-meter peaks&#x2014;trains his sights on Mount Everest in richly detailed accounts of expeditions that are by turns personal, harrowing, deadly, and inspiring.<br> <br>The highest mountain on earth, Everest remains the ultimate goal for serious high-altitude climbers. Viesturs has gone on eleven expeditions to Everest, spending more than two years of his life on the mountain and reaching the summit seven times. No climber today is better poised to survey Everest&#x2019;s various ascents&#x2014;both personal and historic. Viesturs sheds light on the fate of Mallory and Irvine, whose 1924 disappearance just 800 feet from the summit remains one of mountaineering&#x2019;s greatest mysteries, as well as the multiple tragic last days of Rob Hall and Scott Fischer in 1996, the stuff of which <i>Into Thin Air</i> was made.<br> <br>Informed by the experience of one who has truly been there, <i>The Mountain </i>affords a rare glimpse into that place on earth where Heraclitus&#x2019;s maxim&#x2014;&#x201c;Character is destiny&#x201d;&#x2014;is proved time and again.</p><p><br> <p><b>Jim Whittaker Reflects on Ed Viesturs</b></p> <p><i>On May 1, 1963 Jim Whittaker became the first American to stand atop Mt. Everest, the planet's highest peak. He later led expeditions to K2 resulting in the first American summit of the world's second-highest mountain--and often considered its most dangerous. In 1990, he returned to Mt. Everest with International Peace Climb, leading a group of mountaineers from the United States, China, and the Soviet Union to the summit--a team that included an up-and-coming climber named Ed Viesturs. For the publication of </i>The Mountain: My Time on Everest<i>, Whittaker looks back at his time with Viesturs, as well as his nearly unparalleled high-altitude abilities.</i> </p> <p>Ed and I first began jumping crevasses--and pulling people out of them--on the glaciers of Mt. Rainier in Washington State.</p> <p>At 14,410 feet above sea level, Mt. Rainier is less than half as high as 29,035-foot Mt. Everest, but it has all the snow, ice, rock, storms and altitude necessary to make it a wonderful educator for those who would climb high mountains.</p> <p>Although a generation apart, Ed and I both worked as guides, taking clients who had never climbed before to the summit. As guides, we learned to watch our rope mates closely, because--tied to us--they could kill us. You didn't want to climb with someone who was NOT afraid of heights. Eventually, separated by almost three decades, we each reached the top of the world.</p> <p>On May 1, 1963, along with Sherpa Nawang Gombu, I was lucky enough to become the first American to summit Mt. Everest. On May 7, 1990, as a member of the Mt. Everest International Peace Climb, of which I was the leader, Ed reached the highest point on earth, without the use of bottled oxygen. Our team included climbers from the then Soviet Union, China, Tibet and America, joining together for a "summit on the summit," demonstrating what could be achieved through diplomacy and friendship. It was on this climb that I saw Ed exercise his leadership and guiding skills, along with his incredible ability to climb up and down, up and down, and up and up and up.</p> <p>There are just 14 mountains on earth that stick up into the "Death Zone"--above 8,000 meters--and Mt. Everest, Qomolangma, Goddess Mother of the World is the highest. My friend, Ed Viesturs, has climbed them all without bottled oxygen, the first and only American to do so. Mt. Everest he's done more than once. Much more.</p> <p>Now, imagine this: While breathing bottled oxygen, I was taking three to four breaths with every step on the upper slopes of Everest, literally panting for hours and hours to the top. Ed has climbed the 14 highest peaks on earth, taking three to four, six to eight, 10 to 12 to 15 breaths to a step as he ascended. He says, "When I get to 15 breaths a step I begin to wonder if I should turn around." Is there any wonder his climbing friends honor him by referring to Ed as "an ANIMAL?"</p> <p>Yet Ed has retained his humility and is warm and friendly. He has a good sense of humor and he is just a nice person. He is unique. Read his new book (and his several others) and see if you can figure this guy out.</p> <p>--Jim Whittaker, October 2013</p> <p><i>Learn more about Jim Whittaker and the first successful ascent of Mt.

Feist lives in Sante Fe.Prologue<br><br>Darkwind<br><br>The wind came from nowhere.<br><br>Ringing into existence with the reverberation of a hammer striking doom, it carried the heat of a forge that fashioned hot war and searing death, It came into being in the heart of a lost land, emerging from some strange place between that which is and that which seeks to be. It blew from the south, where snakes walked upright and spoke ancient words. Angry, it stank of ancient evil, echoing with long-forgotten prophecies. In a frenzy the wind spun, swirling out of the void, seeking a course; then it paused, then it blew northward.<br><br>The old nurse hummed a simple tune, one handed down from mother to daughter for generations, while she sewed. She paused to glance up from her needlework. Her two small charges lay sleeping, tiny faces serene while they dreamed their tiny dreams. Occasionally fingers would flex or lips would purse in sucking motions, then one or the other would return to quiescence. They were beautiful babies and would grow to be handsome lads, of this the nurse was certain. As men they would have only vague memories of the woman who sat with them this night, but for now they belonged as much to her as to their mother, who sat with her husband presiding over a state dinner. Then through the window a strange wind came, chilling her despite its heat. It carried a hint of alien and distorted dissonance in its sound, an evil tune barely perceived. The nurse shivered and looked toward the boys. They became restless, as if ready to wake crying. The nurse hurried to the window and closed the shutters, blocking out the strange and disquieting night air. For a moment it seemed all time held its breath, then, as if with a slight sigh, the breeze died away and the night was calm again. The nurse tightened her shawl about her shoulders and the babies stirred fitfully for another moment, before lapsing into a deep and quiet sleep.<br><br>In another room nearby, a young man worked over a list, struggling to put aside personal likes and dislikes as he decided who was to serve at a minor function the next day. It was a task he hated, but he did it well. Then the wind made the window curtains blow inward. Without thinking, the youngster was half out of his chair in a crouch, a dirk seeming to fly from his boot top to his hand, as a street-born sense of wariness signaled danger. Poised to fight, he stood with heart pounding for a long moment, as certain of a death struggle as he had ever been in his conflict-torn life. Seeing no one there, the young man slowly relaxed. The moment was lost. He shook his head in perplexity. An odd queasiness settled in the pit of his stomach as he slowly crossed to the window. For long, slowly passing minutes he gazed toward the north, into the night, where he knew the great mountains lay, and beyond, where an enemy of dark aspect waited. The young man's eyes narrowed as he stared into the gloom, as if seeking to catch a glimpse of some danger lurking out there. Then, as the last of the rage and fear fled, he returned to his task. But throughout the balance of the night he occasionally turned to look out the window.<br><br>Out in the city a group of revelers made their way through the streets, seeking another inn and more merry companions. The wind blew past them and they halted a moment, exchanging glances. One, a seasoned mercenary, began to walk again, then halted, considering something. With a sudden loss of interest in celebration, he bade his companions good night and returned to the palace where he had guested for almost a year.<br><br>The wind blew out to sea where a ship raced toward its home port after a long patrol. The captain, a tall old man with a scarred face and a white eye, paused as he was touched by the freshening wind. He was about to call for the sheets to be shortened when a strange chill passed through him. He looked over to his first mate, a pock-faced man who had been at his side for years. They exchanged glances, then the wind passed. The captain paused, gave the order to send men aloft, and, after another silent moment, shouted for extra lanterns to be lit against the suddenly oppressive gloom.<br><br>Farther to the north, the wind blew through the streets of a city, creating angry little dust swirls that danced a mad caper across the cobbles, skittering along like demented jesters. Within this city men from another world lived beside men born there. In the soldiers' commons of the garrison, a man from that other world wrestled one raised within a mile of where the match was taking place, with heavy wagering among those who watched. Each man had taken one fall and the third would decide the winner. The wind suddenly struck and the two opponents paused, looking about. Dust stung eyes and several seasoned veterans suppressed shudders. Without words the two opponents quit the match, and those who had placed wagers picked up their bets without protest. Silently those in the commons returned to their quarters, the festive mood of the contest having fled before the bitter wind.<br><br>The wind swept northward until it struck a forest where little apelike beings, gentle and shy, huddled in the branches, seeking a warmth that only close physical contact can provide. Below, on the floor of the forest, a man sat in meditative pose. His legs were crossed and he rested the backs of his wrists upon his knees, thumbs and forefingers forming circles that represent the Wheel of Life to which all creatures are bound. His eyes snapped open at the first caress of the darkling wind and he regarded the being who sat facing him. An old elf, showing but the faint signs of age native to his race, contemplated the human for a moment, seeing the unspoken question. He nodded his head slightly. The human picked up the two weapons that lay at his side. The long sword and halfsword he placed in his belt sash, and with only a gesture of farewell he was off, moving through the trees of the forest as he began his journey to the sea. There he would seek out another man, one who was also counted friend to the elves, and prepare for the final confrontation that would soon begin. As the warrior made his way toward the ocean the leaves rustled in the branches over his head.<br><br>In another forest, leaves also trembled, in sympathy with those troubled by the passing darkwind. Across an enormous gulf of stars, around a greenish yellow sun spun a hot planet. Upon that world, below the cap of ice at the north pole, lay a forest twin to that left behind by the traveling warrior. Deep within that second forest sat a circle of beings steeped in timeless lore. They wove magic. A soft, warm glow of light formed a sphere about them, as each sat upon the bare earth, richly colored robes unblemished by stain of soil. All eyes were closed, but each saw what he or she needed to see. One, ancient beyond the memory of the others, sat above the circle, suspended in air by the strength of the spell they all wove together. His white hair hung below his shoulders, held back by a simple wire of copper set with a single jade stone upon his forehead. His palms were held up and forward, and his eyes were fixed upon another, a black-robed human, who floated opposite him. That other rode the currents of arcane energy forming a matrix about him, sending his consciousness along those lines, mastering this alien magic. The black-robed one sat in mirror pose, his hands held palm out, but his eyes were closed as he learned. He mentally caressed the fabric of this ancient elven sorcery and felt the intertwined energies of every living thing in this forest, taken and lightly turned, never forced, toward the needs of the community. Thus the Spellweavers used their powers: gently, but persistently, spinning the fiber of these ever natural energies into a thread of magic that could be used. He touched the magic with his mind and he knew. He knew his powers were growing beyond human understanding, becoming godlike in comparison to what he had once thought were the limits of his talents. He had mastered much in the passing year, yet he knew there was much more to learn. Still, with his tutoring he now had the means to find other sources of knowledge. The secrets known to few but the greatest masters--to pass between worlds by strength of will, to move through time, and even to cheat death--he now understood were possible. And with that understanding, he knew he would someday discover the means of mastering those secrets. If he was granted enough time. And time was at a premium. The leaves of the trees echoed the rustle of the distant darkwind. The man in black set dark eyes upon the ancient being floating before him, as both withdrew their minds from the matrix. Speaking by the strength of mind, the man in black said, So soon, Acaila?<br><br>The other smiled, and pale blue eyes shone forth with a light of their own, a light which when first seen had startled the man in black. Now he knew that light came from a deep power beyond any he had known in any mortal save one other. But this was a different power, not the astonishing might of that other but the soothing, healing power of life, love, and serenity. This being was truly one with all around him. To gaze into those glowing eyes was to be made whole, and his smile was a comfort to see. But the thoughts that crossed the distance between the two as they gently floated earthward were troubled. It has been a year. It would have served us all had we more time, but time passes as it will, and it may be that you are ready. Then with a texture of thought the black-robed man had come to understand was humor, he added aloud, "But ready or unready, it is time."<br><br>The others rose as one and for a silent moment the black-clad one felt their minds join with his, in a final farewell. They were sending him back to where a struggle was under way, a struggle in which he was to play a vital part. But they were sending him with much more than he had possessed when he had come to them. He felt the last contact, and said, "Thank you. I will return to where I can travel quickly home." Without further words he closed his eyes, and vanished. Those in the circle were silent a moment, then each turned to undertake whatever task awaited him or her. In the branches the leaves remained restless and the echo of the darkwind was slow in fading.<br><br>The darkwind blew until it reached a ridge trail above a distant vale, where a band of men crouched in hiding. For a brief moment they faced the south, as if seeking the source of this oddly disturbing wind, then they returned to observing the plains below. The two closest to the edge had ridden long and hard in response to a report by an outriding patrol. Below, an army gathered under banners of ill aspect. The leader, a greying tall man with a black patch over his right eye, hunkered down below the ridge. "It's as bad as we feared," he said in hushed tones.<br><br>The other man, not as tall but stouter, scratched at a grey-shot black beard as he squatted beside his companion. "No, it's worse," he whispered. "By the number of campfires, there's one hell of a storm brewing down there."<br><br>The man with the eye patch sat silently for a long moment. "Well, we've somehow gained a year. I expected them to hit us last summer. It is well we prepared, for now they'll surely come." He moved in a crouch as he returned to where a tall, blond man held his horse. "Are you staying?"<br><br>The second man said, "Yes, I think I'll watch for a while. By seeing how many arrive and at what rate, I may hazard a good guess at how many he's bringing."<br><br>The leader mounted. The blond man said, "What matter? When he comes, he'll bring all he has."<br><br>"I just don't like surprises, I suppose."<br><br>"How long?" asked the first man.<br><br>"Two, three days at most, then it will get too crowded hereabouts."<br><br>"They're certain to have patrols out by now. Two days at the most." With a grim smile he said, "You're not much as company goes, but after two years I've grown used to having you around. Be careful."<br><br>The second man flashed a broad grin. "That cuts two ways. You've stung them enough for the last two years: they'd love to throw a net over you. It wouldn't do to have them show up at the city gates with your head on a battle pike."<br><br>The blond man said, "That will not happen." His open smile was in contrast to his tone, one of determination the other two knew well.<br><br>"Well, just see it doesn't. Now get along."<br><br>The company moved out, with one rider staying behind to accompany the stout man in his watch. After a long minute of observing, the stout man muttered softly, "What are you up to this time, you misbegotten son of a motherless whoremonger? Just what are you going to throw at us this summer, Mormandamus?"</p><h2>The Gun Seller</h2><p>Hugh Laurie concocts an uproarious cocktail of comic zingers and over-the-top action in this "ripping spoof of the spy genre" <i>(Vanity Fair)</i> -- the irresistible tale of a former Scots Guard-turned-hired gun, a freelance soldier of fortune who also happens to be one heck of a nice guy. <br> Cold-blooded murder just isn't Thomas Lang's cup of tea.

If reader Bruce Reizen were at the very top of his game, he could do little to improve THE TRENCH. But Reizen is spotty at best. Dialogue and characterizations are strong, but narrative sections lack conviction and assurance. All in all THE TRENCH might make a credible abridgment.

He was the last of the nation's great continental explorers and the first of a new breed of public servant: part scientist, part social reformer, part institution builder. His work and life reveal an enduringly valuable way of thinking about land, water, and society as parts of an interconnected whole; he was America's first great bioregional thinker.</p><p><i>Seeing Things Whole</i> presents John Wesley Powell in the full diversity of his achievements and interests, bringing together in a single volume writings ranging from his gripping account of exploring the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon to his views on the evolution of civilization, along with the seminal writings in which he sets forth his ideas on western settlement and the allocation and management of western resources.</p><p>The centerpiece of <i>Seeing Things Whole</i> is a series of selections from the famous 1878 Report on the Lands of the Arid Region and related magazine articles in which Powell further develops the themes of the report. In those, he recommends organizing the Arid Lands into watershed commonwealths governed by resident citizens whose interlocking interests create the checks and balances essential to wise stewardship of the land. This was the central focus of John Wesley Powell's bioregional vision, and it remains a model for governance that many westerners see as a viable solution to the resource management conflicts that continue to bedevil the region.</p><p>Throughout the collection, award-winning writer and historian William deBuys brilliantly sets the historical context for Powell's work. Section introductions and extensive descriptive notes take the reader through the evolution of John Wesley Powell's interests and ideas from his role as an officer in the Civil War through his critique of Social Darwinism and landmark categorization of Indian languages, to the climatic yet ultimately futile battles he fought to win adoption of his land-use proposals.</p><p><i>Seeing Things Whole</i>&nbsp;presents the essence of the extraordinary legacy that John Wesley Powell has left to the American people, and to people everywhere who strive to reconcile the demands of society with the imperatives of the land.</p><br></p><p><p>William deBuys is a historian, conservationist, and writer based in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

He is famous for the 1869 Powell Geographic Expedition, a three-month river trip down the Green and Colorado rivers that included the first known passage through the Grand Canyon."This is a superb selection of the most important writings of the great American explorer, scientist, and conservationist. Powell's name has often been evoked over the past century, but few people have had access to the full range of his vigorous prose. Now deBuys has given us an exceptionally good introduction to the man, his ideas, and his America."

Sherman's Union troops began their campaign for Atlanta in the spring of 1864, they encountered Confederate forces employing field fortifications located to take advantage of rugged terrain. While the Confederates consistently acted on the defensive, digging eighteen lines of earthworks from May to September, the Federals used fieldworks both defensively and offensively. With 160,000 troops engaged on both sides and hundreds of miles of trenches dug, fortifications became a defining factor in the Atlanta campaign battles. These engagements took place on topography ranging from Appalachian foothills to the clay fields of Georgia's piedmont.<br><br>Leading military historian Earl J. Hess examines how commanders adapted their operations to the physical environment, how the environment in turn affected their movements, and how Civil War armies altered the terrain through the science of field fortification. He also illuminates the impact of fighting and living in ditches for four months on the everyday lives of both Union and Confederate soldiers. The Atlanta campaign represents one of the best examples of a prolonged Union invasion deep into southern territory, and, as Hess reveals, it marked another important transition in the conduct of war from open field battles to fighting from improvised field fortifications.<br><br></p><p>Earl J.

In the months that followed, life as she had known it came apart, &#34;like a jigsaw dismantled into a heap of broken-edged pieces&#34;. Aftermath chronicles this perilous journey as the author redefines herself as a single woman and creates a new version of family life for her daughters. She discovers previously unknown strengths and freedoms but also finds herself suddenly vulnerable to outsiders, unwelcome advice, social displacement and the absence of a clear authority. &#34;I can&#39;t remember what it feels like to be at ease. This ceaseless effort to manufacture normality is a kind of forger&#39;s art, so laborious compared with the facility that created the original.&#34; The pressure to reconstruct a &#39;normal&#39; life for her daughters competes with the sense that nothing feels normal at all. Aftermathis a masterly work in which the author, at her most candid and rigorous, charts the largely unwritten journey back to order from the chaos that is left when a family breaks apart.</p><p>Rachel Cusk was born in 1967 and is the author of seven novels: Saving Agnes, which won the Whitbread First Novel Award, The Temporary, The Country Life, which won a Somerset Maugham Award, The Lucky Ones, which was shortlisted for the Whitbread Novel Award, In the Fold and Arlington Park, which was shortlisted for the Orange Prize and The Bradshaw Variations.

British photographer Derek Ridgers has documented the perennial youth ritual of dressing up and going out since he first picked up a camera in 1971, and has been drawn to virtually every subculture London has spawned, from punk to the fetish club scene of the present. From early on his photographs attracted the attention of both cultural institutions such as London&#x2019;s ICA and music and style publications such as the <i>NME</i> and <i>The Face</i>. These photographs, made over a ten-year span, capture punk&#x2019;s evolution into goth, the skinhead revival and the New Romantic scene, and the eventual emergence of Acid House and the new psychedelia. Gathered here, Ridgers&#x2019; images serve not only as a fascinating document of UK style and culture but as a testament to the creative spirit of youth; he lauds his subjects and their sartorial DIY panache. Among those portrayed are Boy George, Andrew Logan, Leigh Bowery and his boyfriend Trojan, Michael Alig, John Galliano, Hamish Bowles, Cerith Wyn Evans, Steve Strange and Martin Kemp and Steve Norman of Spandau Ballet.<br><b>Derek Ridgers</b> (born 1950) is an English photographer with a career spanning more than 30 years. He is best known for his photography of music, film, club and street culture, and has photographed stars from James Brown to The Spice Girls, from Clint Eastwood to Johnny Depp, as well politicians, gangsters, artists, writers, fashion designers and sportsmen.</p><p>Derek Ridgers is an English photographer with a career spanning over thirty years. He is best known for his photography of music, film and club/ street culture - photographing everyone from James Brown to The Spice Girls, from Clint Eastwood to Johnny Depp - as well as photographing politicians (Tony Blair), gangsters (&#39;Mad&#39; Frankie Fraser), artists (Julian Schnabel), writers (Martin Amis), fashion designers (Vivien Westwood) and sportsmen (Tiger Woods). He has also photographed famous and sometimes influential British social scenes such as skinhead, fetish, club, punk and the New Romantics. Derek Ridgers&#39;s work has been exhibited internationally since the seventies in cities as far ranging as London, Paris, Moscow, Adelaide and Los Angeles, and in venues such as the Institute of Contemporary Arts, Museum of Modern Art, National Portrait Gallery, Tate Modern, Tate Britain, Museum of London, Britart Gallery, Selfridges and the Victoria and Albert Museum.These photographs captured across the span of ten years bridge the extremities of youth-culture; from punk through to the brith of acid house. The pictures serve not only as a fascinating document of UK style and culture but as a testament to the spirit of youth, lauding the subjects and their individuality. This book offers us the chance to see the changing faces of fashion, music and culture through individuals and influential social scenes in a time of DIY attitudes. (Alex Nicholson <i>Juxtapoz</i>)<br><br>In 1976, when, at the age of 26, Derek Ridgers began photographing London youth culture, he thought that he was far too old to participate in the scene. Despite his supposed dotage, though, he went on to spend the next decade haunting clubs with names like Billy's and the Blitz, capturing the madly creative fashion wonderland blossoming after dark. (L.Y. <i>Vogue</i>)<br><br>In his new art book, Ridgers intimately documents the confluence of creativity born of the late-'70s/early-'80s London club scene of punks, new romantics, and skinheads--armed with safety pins and eyeliner--who took to the night to revel in its freedom and defy the drab conventions of the waking hours.

Evening was coming on, and the pelting rain was cold.<br><br>We dug in our heels and slid down the embankment to get under the bridge, where there was shelter of a sort. We built a fire, then huddled over it wondering what had become of our summer's wages.<br><br>Three of us were there, strangers until a few hours ago, now joined in the idea of going west. I'd be going home, or to as much of a home as I could lay claim to, being rootless as a tumbleweed, blowing on, resting here and there against this fence or that, but staying nowhere long. As for the others, I had no idea.<br><br>The black skeleton frame of the trestle danced in the wavering light from the fire, and from time to time the flames guttered and hissed as the wind blew down the draw, spattering us with cold drops from off the bridge.<br><br>Rustling around for wood reminded me of a winter I spent in Montana one time . . . at the Hartman &amp; Liggett horse camp. No snow on the ground all winter long, only flurries from time to time, but cold. The ice froze rock-hard on the creek that year, and never broke until late spring.<br><br>Taking all in all, that had been a good winter. The cabin was snug against the wind, the pot-bellied stove gave off almost too much heat, and there were old magazines and a couple of books lying around.<br><br>When not in a mind to read, I'd sit and ponder. Whilst only a youngster I had taken to rebuilding places in my mind, places I'd lived in or seen, and when I'd nothing else to do I would put a place together, every single thing in place, then bit by bit I'd recall the folks I'd known there and what was said--what we talked about, and the like. It gave me something to do, but no great respect for the high art of conversational talk.<br><br>When a man sets out to recall in detail as I did, he sets more to working than he's figured on, for he never looks at anything after that without thinking how he'll recall it in time to come. It also sets a man to thinking about himself, and when a man stands himself up to ponder at, he can't always be pleased at what he sees.<br><br>No working cowhand is going to get very far unless he's a hand to notice. Punching cows takes you over a lot of rough country, and pretty soon you get to know every draw, hill, or clump of brush. You notice the game trails and the springs, and where the cattle go for shelter, and a lot more besides. A man has to notice or he won't get very far at punching cows.<br><br>Back there at the Hartman &amp; Liggett horse camp there'd always been a brown crock of baked beans, and I'd never had my fill of beans. Sitting there beside that hateful fire under the trestle with night coming on, I kept thinking back to that horse camp and those crocks of beans. They would be tasty, mighty tasty, right now.<br><br>That big colored boy, he looked at me and he said, "You look like you been in a fight."<br><br>"Here an' there," I said.<br><br>"You fight with the mitts?"<br><br>"Nobody ever showed me. I just fight the best way I know how."<br><br>"I've boxed," he said.<br><br>He was a big boy, maybe a year or two older than my twenty-six years, standing around six feet, and built strong. And he had good hands.<br><br>That was the first thing he said about me. "You got good hands." He doubled up my fist. "Flat across the knuckles. Stands shock better. You could punch, I think."<br><br>Puttering around, I fetched back a few more sticks. A branch or two, a few old sticks and such-like--anything to keep the fire going.<br><br>"When did you say that freight was due?" Van Bokkelen asked.<br><br>"Ten-twelve, if it's on time."<br><br>Van Bokkelen was a big blond man, raw-boned and with an uncurried look--shaggy hair and a broad, tough face, yet not bad-looking. He had small, ice-blue eyes, no more warmth in them than in the head of a nail.<br><br>Twelve hours before no one of us had known the others. We'd come together in jail, in the drunk tank. Only I'd been pulled in for fighting, and it wasn't the first time. Seemed like I was always being arrested for fighting. Not that I knew much about it, but I just naturally liked to fight.<br><br>The wind blew cold. Rain spattered over us, and I hitched the collar of my cloth suit-coat higher around my ears and stretched my hands toward the flames.<br><br>We were sheltered in part by a bank of drift sand; on our left ran a small stream. The rain was falling harder now, the gusts were more frequent.<br><br>"You got a place?" Eddie Holt, the colored boy, asked. "I mean, you got a place to go to?"<br><br>"I got no place, and never had no place except west." With a gesture I indicated my sacked-up saddle. "My home's been in the middle of that."<br><br>"You got to have a horse."<br><br>"You think so, do you? Sometimes I figure I've packed that saddle damn near as far as I've rode horses."<br><br>"I'd be damned if I'd pack it," Van Bokkelen said. "I'd steal a horse before I'd do that."<br><br>"It's been done," I admitted, not wanting to argue principle with a stranger over a friendly fire.<br><br>We listened to the rain, and hopefully listened for a train whistle, but it was a long while until train time and I was hungry as a springtime bear fresh out of hibernation.<br><br>"Maybe I could get me a riding job," Eddie suggested.<br><br>"There was a colored boy rode for an outfit I worked for down New Mexico way. He was a good hand. Can you ride?"<br><br>"I never rode for no cow outfit, but I rode in a Buffalo Bill show." He grinned at me. "I was an Indian."<br><br>"You ain't the first," I said, and then added, "They tell me you really got to ride for Cody."<br><br>"I can ride. I can rope a little. But I never rode for no cow outfit."<br><br>"A man who can't live without working," Van Bokkelen scoffed, "is a fool. I'd see myself in hell before I'd eat dust behind a bunch of cows."<br><br>Well, I sat quiet, feeling the Old Ned coming up in me. All my life I've punched cows or worked hard for what little I'd had, and I didn't cotton to this stranger making me out a fool. Come to think of it, he didn't seem to be doing so well.<br><br>Eddie Holt, he sat quiet, too, and never said aye, yes, or no, and that seemed to be a good idea. This blond gent was a whole lot bigger than me, and my ribs and jaw were still sore from my last fight.<br><br>"You do what you're of a mind to," I said after a minute. "I'll punch cows."<br><br>"For thirty a month?" he sneered. "You boys come along with me and you'll be wearin' silk shirts and broadcloth. I could use two men like you."<br><br>Back up the line I heard a footstep splash in the water. "Somebody comin'," I said, and turned my head to look. When I looked back Van Bokkelen was gone.<br><br>"Sit close," Eddie warned. "It's the Law."<br><br>It sure was. There were four of them, four big men wearing slickers and armed with shotguns. They had spread out as they came up to the fire and they looked from one to the other of us.<br><br>"You!" The man I knew as the sheriff gestured with his shotgun. "Stand up!" He came up to me. "You armed?"<br><br>"I owned a Winchester one time," I said. "Never had no use for a hand gun."<br><br>He went over me with as smooth and knowing a frisk as ever I got, then did the same for Eddie.<br>"You haven't even got a knife? Or a razor?"<br><br>Eddie lifted his big hands. "Never had use for anything but these," he said.<br><br>The sheriff looked around at a narrow-faced, red-haired man. "Didn't you say there were three of them? You had three of them, you said."<br><br>"That's right. They didn't come together, but they left together. The black boy there, he was straight vag. Loafing around, no visible means of support. We gave him overnight in jail and a floater.<br><br>"The one in the broad hat, he got into a fight with Salty Breakenridge over to Ryan's. They busted up the place."<br><br>The sheriff looked at me with respect. "With Salty? I saw him. I figured it had to be a bigger man than you. What do you weigh, puncher?"<br><br>"Hundred and seventy," I said. "I never seen size makes too much difference." Then kind of grudgingly I had to acknowledge, "Although that there Salty . . . I'd say he was a fair hand."<br><br>The sheriff chuckled. "Yes, I'd say that. Nobody ever whipped him before."<br><br>He kicked the sack containing my gear. "What's in that?"<br><br>"Saddle. I'm headed west."<br><br>"How'd you come east? Trainload of cattle?"<br><br>"Uh-huh."<br><br>The quiet man with the gray eyes had said nothing up to then, but he had been looking around. "Where's the other one?" he asked. "The big blond man?"<br><br>"Ain't seen him," I said, "only once since we left jail. He was headin' for Ryan's and a drink." I grinned at them. "I figured I'd no business goin' back there."<br><br>They just looked at me, and then the quiet man said, "Don't cover for him, boys. He isn't worth it. That's a bad man."<br><br>"I wouldn't know," I said, "but you had him in jail--why didn't you keep him?"<br><br>The sheriff spat. "Because we didn't know who he was. Like damn fools we let him go. Then Fargo here, he got to thinking about an old reward poster. There's a reward on that man . . . dead or alive. He's wanted for murder."<br><br>Eddie, he never even looked at me.<br><br>"How much?" I said, for I was curious.<br><br>"Five thousand."<br>Hell, I never seen that much money in my whole lifetime. You don't see much, working for thirty a month and found. It was a lucky thing when I put forty saved dollars into a saddle.<br><br>Fargo looked at me. "What's your name, cowpuncher?"<br><br>"Pike," I said, "Barnabas Pike. Some places they call me Pronto."<br><br>"Pronto? Because you're fast?"<br><br>Me, I grinned at him. "Maybe because I swing too quick," I said. "I got a mean temper when I'm riled, but it ain't always that. I never had much fun . . . except fightin'."<br><br>"I can believe it," the sheriff said. "I saw Salty Breakenridge after."<br><br>They poked around a little, stared off down the stream bed, and then they started off. Only Fargo lingered. He kicked at the ground where Van Bokkelen had sat. "Five thousand," he said, "is a lot of money."<br><br>"Mister," I said, "I seen that gent in jail and I didn't cotton to him, but I never sold anybody out yet, and I ain't about to start."<br><br>"I thought you'd be that way," Fargo said quietly, "but don't tangle with that man. You leave him alone, cowpuncher. He's bad medicine."<br><br>"You been west," I said.<br><br>"A time or two," he said. "And maybe again."<br><br>Then he walked off after the others, and we said nothing, Eddie Holt and me, watching them go.<br><br>Finally Eddie picked up sticks and added them to the fire. "Murder," he said--"that's bad. I wonder who he killed?"<br><br>"He's full of mean," I said. "I could see it in him."<br><br>I looked at Eddie. "You goin' any place particular? If you ain't, come along with me. Two can starve as free as one, and if I get a ridin' job I'll speak for you."<br><br>"I take that kindly," he said.<br><br>The fire was warm; the wind had gone down and the rain had about stopped. There was still the sound of the big drops falling off the trestle.<br><br>A long time we sat quiet, and me wishing I could catch some shut-eye, but little time remained if we were going to catch that drag. I kept squatting there thinking about how I wished there'd be an empty on that train. I'd never liked riding freights unless there was an empty.<br><br>"We're partners, Pronto?" Eddie said.<br><br>"Why not?" I said, and then the train whistled far off.<br><br>We got up and Eddie kicked out the fire mostly, and then scooped water from the creek with an old can and poured it over what was left to put it out. Then we struggled up to the trestle together.<br><br>The train slowed up along here, with a good grade ahead, and a man could take it moving.<br><br>"Can you make it? Totin' that saddle?"<br><br>"You watch me."<br><br>We let a dozen cars go by, and then Eddie saw an open door as it passed a red light on a switch, and called out to me. He was a fast man, making the run easy and swinging up, and he caught my saddle as I swung it at the opening. Me, I caught the edge of the floor and hauled myself up, the ground slipping away behind me.<br><br>Long after Eddie had rolled up in some paper he found at one end of the car, I sat there by the open door, a-looking out at the country. Here and there we flipped past lonely farms with lights in the windows . . . one time there was a man walking to-ward the house with a lantern and a milk pail, and a dog barking at the train.<br><br>"Dirt farmers," I sneered. "Home guards!" But away down inside I wasn't sneering at all. That man was going into his own house to set down to his supper at his own table, with his kinfolk around him.<br><br>And me? All I had was a lonesome whistle sound as the train bent around a curve, the distant glow of the firebox, and somewhere down the line a flea-bitten cow pony, and a chuck wagon for home.<br><i><br>Chapter Two<br><br></i><br>When I woke up it was daylight and the train was bumping along at a good pace. Walking to the door, I could see patches of woods, a stream and miles of wheat fields slipping by.<br><br>Eddie sat up. "That right, what you said? We're partners?"<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>"Where all we goin'?"<br><br>"West . . . I dunno. Maybe Miles City . . . Medora. First place that looks likely."<br><br>"I could eat. Boy, but I could eat!"<br><br>"You an' me," I said.<br><br>"You been punchin' cows a long time?"</p><h2>A Constellation of Vital Phenomena</h2><p><b>Stegner Fellow, Iowa MFA, and winner of the<i> Atlantic</i>'s emerging writer contest, Anthony Marra has written a brilliant debut novel that brings to life an abandoned hospital where a tough-minded doctor decides to harbour a hunted young girl, with powerful consequences.</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final days of December 2004, in a small rural village in Chechnya, 8-year-old Havaa hides in the woods when her father is abducted by Russian forces.

Over the course of 5 dramatic days, Akhmed and Sonya reach back into their pasts to unravel the intricate mystery of coincidence, betrayal and forgiveness that unexpectedly binds them and decides their fate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With <i>The English Patient</i>'s dramatic sweep and <i>The Tiger's Wife</i>'s expert sense of place, Marra gives us a searing debut about the transcendent power of love in wartime, and how it can cause us to become greater than we ever thought possible.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Anthony Marra</b></p> <p><strong>Q. Where did you study in Russia? How did that pique your interest?</strong></p> <p>A. As a junior in college I studied in St. Petersburg. War journalist and human rights activist Anna Politkovskaya had recently been assassinated; wounded veterans of the Chechen Wars trawled the metro cars for alms; street gangs routinely attacked people from the Northern Caucasus. Yet as an American I knew little about Chechnya. As soon as I began researching its incredible history, I never looked back.</p> <p><strong>Q. The setting of your book takes place during the Chechen Wars. Why did you choose this period of history as the backdrop of your novel?</strong></p> <p>A. Chechnya is a corner of the world largely mysterious to most Americans, yet it&#x2019;s a remarkable place populated with remarkable people who have become accustomed to repeatedly rebuilding their lives. To quote Tobias Wolff, &#x201c;We are made to persist...that&#x2019;s how we find out who we are.&#x201d; These characters commit acts of courage, betrayal, and forgiveness as they persist in saving what means most to them&#x2014;be it their families, their honor, or themselves&#x2014;from the destruction of war.</p> <p><strong>Q. The title of the book has a story. Can you please explain its meaning?</strong></p> <p>A. One day I looked up the definition of <i>life</i> in a medical dictionary and found a surprisingly poetic entry: &#x201c;A constellation of vital phenomena&#x2014;organization, irritability, movement, growth, reproduction, adaptation.&#x201d; As biological life is structured as a constellation of six phenomena, the narrative life of this novel is structured as a constellation of six point-of-view characters. </p> <p><strong>Q. Your writing style is unique in that you move back and forth between the present and the past. Was that a conscious choice?</strong></p> <p>A. Very much so. I wanted to write a novel expansive enough to cover the decade of the two Chechen Wars without losing the drama and suspense inherent in a more tightly coiled plot. By weaving the five-day story of a hunted girl through a larger backdrop, I hoped to combine the tension of a character-driven thriller with the richness of a historical epic. Also, moving through time shines a light on the seemingly trivial moments, relationships, and allegiances that affect characters in profound ways years down the line.</p> <p><strong>Q. What has had the greatest influence on your writing?</strong></p> <p>A. My mom has six siblings and my dad has four sisters and between them all there are more cousins than I count, which means that family events have always been filled with voices, stories, and laughter. From an early age I learned from them that stories are how we understand one another, how we preserve the past, and how we make meaning from the chaos of our lives.</p> <strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, May 2013</strong>: In <em>A Constellation of Vital Phenomena</em>, Anthony Marra takes us to snow-covered Chechnya during the Second Chechen War. The novel, a remarkable decade-spanning debut, opens with eight-year-old Havaa looking on as her father is dragged off by Russian soldiers for a crime he did not commit. The soldiers set fire to Havaa's home, and next-door neighbor Akhmed attempts to hide her at nearby hospital. Sonya, the doctor who runs the facility, is hesitant to harbor Havaa, as the child invites unnecessary risk to her barely functioning hospital, but both she and Akhmed realize that Havaa represents something greater than a single life: she is the key to maintaining humanity in an ethnic conflict that is absurd and unjust. "There are things a person shouldn't understand," Akhmed says. "There are things a person has a moral duty never to understand." But by the end of <em>Vital Phenomena</em>, we do understand--with deeply emotional characters and gripping depiction of wartorn Chechnya, Marra makes us understand. --<em>Kevin Nguyen</em><p>ANTHONY MARRA is currently a Wallace Stegner Fellow at Stanford University, with an MFA from the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop.

This book provides an insightinto the very private life of the man himself.</p><p>Andrew Lycett read history at Oxford University, before becoming a journalist on the Sunday Times where he served as a foreign correspondent.A rich life story is matched with an ideal reader. Andrew Lycett&#39;s literate, well-researched biography of Ian Fleming--whose string of James Bond novels capped an exciting life that included wartime service, espionage and love affairs--is an absorbing account of one of the most fascinating figures of popular culture. Lycett&#39;s sure grasp of the Bond novels also allows him to refer to pertinent and familiar scenes that reflect Fleming&#39;s many travels and earlier experiences. Robert Whitfield narrates the text in clear, crisp BBC English. His brisk pace fits Lycett&#39;s trim, balanced sentences. Fleming loved privilege, and his life story is served well by a reader whose performance connotes a patrician equanimity and style. G.H.

From 1930 Thesiger travelled through remote areas of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. His journeys and his books have won him numerous prestigious awards over the years. In 1968 he was made a CBE; he was honoured with a KBE in 1995.Perhaps the last of the great romantic gentleman-explorers, Thesiger, author of Arabian Sands and The Marsh Arabs, here looks back on an extraordinary life. He was born in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) to British diplomatic parents who were friends of Emperor Haile Selassie. Thesiger remembers Addis Ababa, the capital, as a village with grass huts, no roads and colorful ceremonies. He attended Eton and Oxford, then returned to Africa for the first of many journeys, exploring the Awash River (home to the dreaded Danakil, whose warriors killed randomly to prove their manhood and collected their victims' genitals for trophies). As a district officer in the Sudan Political Service, Thesiger had further opportunities to travel in desert lands and meet nomadic tribes. During World War II, he served with Orde Wingate's troops, liberating Abyssinia from the Italians; later, he fought behind the lines in the Western Desert. In addition to superb adventure, Thesiger gives a fine portrait of the waning days of the British Empire in the Sudan and of the last revolution in Ethiopia.

Now, in this new book, Viorst examines the evolution of Zionism, from its roots by serving as a cultural refuge for Europe's Jews, to the cover it provides today for Israel's exercise of control over millions of Arabs in occupied territories. </p><p>Beginning with the shattering of the traditional Jewish society during the Enlightenment, Viorst covers the recent history of the Jews, from the spread of Jewish Emancipation during the French Revolution Era to the rise of the exclusionary anti-Semitism that overwhelmed Europe in the late nineteenth century. Viorst examines how Zionism was born and follows its development through the lives and ideas of its dominant leaders, who all held only one tenet in common: that Jews, for the first time in two millennia, must determine their own destiny to save themselves. But, in regards to creating a Jewish state with a military that dominates the region, Viorst argues that Israel has squandered the goodwill it enjoyed at its founding, and thus the country has put its own future on very uncertain footing.</p><p>With the expertise and knowledge garnered from decades of studying this contentious region, Milton Viorst deftly exposes the risks that Israel faces today.</p></p><p>MILTON VIORST was the Middle East correspondent for <i>The New Yorker </i>and has written for the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>, the <i>Atlantic</i>, <i>Middle East Policy</i>, <i>Ha'Aretz,</i> <i>The Nation</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, the <i>L.A.

Edison Prize in 1956Grade 1-3?First released in book form in 1946, this story has since appeared in numerous editions. It tells of a small angel who simply can't get with the program no matter how hard he tries until an understanding elder realizes that he is homesick and is able to retrieve a box of his most treasured possessions from "back home." When it comes time for Jesus to be born on Earth, the Littlest Angel gives his precious box to the Baby, but he is worried that God will think his gift too humble. However, God is pleased indeed, and transforms the box into the Star of Bethlehem. The writing style is rather ornate and full of grandiose words and phrases, but some children will love to hear it read aloud. The oil paintings are muted and full of texture, and not at all sentimental. The celestial choir is multicultural, and the Littlest Angel has red shorts peeking out of his robe. Paul Micich's version (Ideals, 1991) has a glossier "greeting-card" look.

In stories rich with the fragrant atmosphere of the gorgeous Sicilian countryside, they share memories of the annual grape harvest, a special Christmas snowstorm, and an illicit childhood trip on a commercial fishing boat. They describe favorite local restaurants and dishes from the past and the present.

This is their second cookbook, and it focuses on home cooking, Sicilian style. Italians are well known for their generous hospitality, and the Tornabene women are great ambassadors. Through dozens of personal stories, some funny, some sad, they invite you into their home to sit at their kitchen table while they reminisce, gossip, educate, and feed you some of the most enjoyable comfort food and conversation you've ever experienced.<p> Wanda was born in Palermo but has lived in Sicily for more than 50 years. She learned to cook from her mother-in-law and passed those lessons down to her daughter. She admits that she was reluctant to share her secret family recipes, but has found great joy and pleasure in doing so. The conversation in the Tornabene home wanders from nutty old Aunt Elvira who collected bus-ticket stubs and used matches to Eggs Poached in Fresh Tomato Sauce. Granny Elena's Bean and Pasta Soup warms the soul, and the naughty escapades of Ciccio, one of Gangivecchio's dogs, will make you laugh. Aromatic Risotto with Gorgonzola and Fennel may be dinner the night you read about Felice, the little lamb who was allowed into bed after he was bathed, but Wanda's Veal Cutlets served with a flavorful sauce made with garlic, onions, tomatoes, and a dash of cayenne will still make your mouth water. Stories of parties with family and friends entice you to make Sicilian-style pizzas topped with four cheeses, zucchini, and thyme or potatoes, sausage, and rosemary, or maybe you'll treat the crowd to "Midnight Spaghetti" variations like Spaghetti with Garlic, Oil, and Hot Pepper or Ruote with Radicchio and Gorgonzola. Sicilian sweets like Ricotta Tart with Nuts and drinks like Strawberry Liqueur round out the menu and ensure that you'll be back to visit with the Tornabene women of Gangivecchio again and again. <i>--Leora Y.

Instead, as a born member of the Yellow Dragon Clan--part human, part dragon, like his grandmother--he is on a quest even he does not understand. His journey takes him to Santo del Vado Viejo in the Arizona desert, a town overrun by gangs, haunted by members of other animal clans, perfumed by delicious food, and set to the beat of Malo Malo, a barrio rock band whose female lead guitarist captures Jay&#39;s heart. He must face a series of dangerous, otherworldly--and very human--challenges to become the man, and dragon, he is meant to be. This is Charles de Lint at his best!</p><p>Charles de Lint lives in Ottawa, Canada.Gr 9 Up&#x2013;De Lint returns to the imaginary location of The Mystery of Grace (Tor, 2009) in this novel set in the American Southwest. Jay Li is a 17-year-old Chinese American transplanted from Chicago's Chinatown to the desert. The title comes from the dragon tattoo on his back, which emerged from his skin when he was 11. Jay is a member of the Yellow Dragon clan, and, thanks to a mystical family inheritance, an actual dragon on a quest to protect mankind. His quest leads him to Santo del Vado Viejo, a town overrun by bandas, gangs, where he is taken in by Rosalie and Anna. Shortly after his arrival, it becomes clear that he is there to discover his dragon nature and to free the town from the gangs. Encounters with the &#x201c;cousins&#x201d; (animal spirits in human form), the gang leader El Tigre, and the mysterious Rita move Jay into an uncertain future that he only half understands. The novel travels back and forth between omniscient narration and Jay's first-person journaling, and while the threads work together, they are sometimes repetitive and oddly juxtaposed. Minor discordant notes regarding cultural and local knowledge may jar readers familiar with the geographic areas or cultural communities; the mythologies of both Chinatown and Santo del Vado Viejo seem superimposed on the locales instead of emerging organically from them. Characterizations are sketchy, making it difficult to invest emotionally in the players.

Each of the woodcuts centers on a young man who we may as well think of as Masereel himself, who was in his early thirties when he cut this novel. The young man is shown in a variety of situations, and a highly romantic account of Masereel's spiritual development emerges. The young artist enters a city by railroad and walks crowded streets with bemused amazement. Throughout the series he undergoes various pleasures and pains of the physical, mental, political, moral, and religious life as a sort of preparation for a Christlike death and spiritual rebirth. This is a thoroughly romantic, ego-centered production which provides a virtual checklist of the social, political, religious, and artistic concerns of Masereel's cultural moment. Audiences today will appreciate its value as a characterization (and equally as a caricature) of European intellectual life during the first two and a half decades of this century. We can no longer flip through it with the passion and mounting excitement which Mann describes in his introduction. For us, such journeys seem to end very close to where they began. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i>Woodcutter, painter, cosmopolitan and anti-militarist, Belgium-born Masereel (1889-1972) was an extremely popular artist in 1920s Germany. A contemporary of Kathe Kollwitz and George Grosz, his "novels-without-words"--completely composed of woodcuts--have been neglected in the States. Here, 165 striking woodcuts generate the visual narrative of a young man's initiation into the urban milieu. The raw power and diversity of the city's day to day events continually expand his understanding of life's possibilities. The hero's fascination with the city's abundance of art and culture, political debate and industrial glory combine with observations on an equal profusion of poignant social trauma. The protagonist travels to distant lands; this journey of vibrant percipience propels him toward an enlarged comprehension of his role in a world of good and evil, love and tenderness and clashing social interests. Mann's effusive introduction discusses Masereel's life and influences and details the ideas that motivated and enliven this vivid work. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Reluctant Dragon (Turtleback School &amp; Library Binding Edition)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.</p><p><p><b>Kenneth Grahame</b> (1859-1932), Scottish-born author, was raised by his grandmother in Berkshire, England, along the banks of the Thames River. He was educated at Oxford and then worked for the Bank of England. As a pastime, he wrote light nonfiction and articles for newspapers. <i>The Wind in the Willows</i>, originally written as letters to his son, established him as a writer of children's books and had a deep influence on fantasy literature.</p>This dramatization of Grahame&#39;s story has wonderfully expressive characterizations to tickle young imaginations. There&#39;s a full gamut of sound effects and music reminiscent of phonograph records of the &#39;50&#39;s. A young boy plays the hero, an innocent voice wiser than the eccentric adults around him. The dragon speaks his pacifist message in slow cartoon-like cadences while St. George delivers his role in a stalwart voice. The male narrator is warm and expressive as host of this appealing program. D.W.

Jessica B. Harris, author of <i>The Africa Cookbook</i>, shows us how big this continent truly is (three times the landmass of Europe; 1,000 different languages); how incredibly ancient its history is; how grand and majestic is the sweep of cooking styles and food flavors that shift from north to south, east to west; and how up-to-the-minute and relevant those food and flavor experiences can be. As with any of Harris's previous books, the reader can savor equal portions of eye-opening scholarship, delectable storytelling, and delicious recipes. <p> The book is divided into chapters that discuss the edible history of Africa, the range of food regions in Africa, a glossary of African ingredients and utensils, and an argument that the much vaunted Mediterranean diet needs to look south for its origins. Recipe chapters fall along traditional lines: appetizers, salads and soups, condiments, vegetables, main dishes, breads and starches, desserts, and beverages--and include dishes from all over the continent. You will find the likes of Sardine Fritters (Algeria), Avocado and Papaya Salad (Kenya), Pili Pili Sauce (western Africa), Mashed Eggplant � la Zeinab (Sudan), and Grilled Shrimp Pili Pili (Mozambique).</p><p> Africa, Harris argues, isn't the Dark Continent, but the "continent about which we are in the dark."

A few years back, he investigated the corrupt&#x2014;and as it turned out, homicidal&#x2014;local school board, and now the town&#x2019;s back in view with more alarming news: A woman&#x2019;s been found dead, frozen in a block of ice. There&#x2019;s a possibility that it might be connected to a high school class of twenty years ago that has a mid-winter reunion coming up, and so, wrapping his coat a little tighter, Virgil begins to dig into twenty years&#x2019; worth of traumas, feuds, and bad blood. In the process, one thing becomes increasingly clear to him.

He is the author of twenty-seven Prey novels, most recently<i> Golden Prey</i>; four Kidd novels, ten Virgil Flowers novels, and six other books, including three YA novels co-authored with his wife Michele Cook.Chapter One<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> David Birkmann sat in his living room with an empty beer can in his hand and stared sadly at his bachelor&#x2019;s oversized television, which wasn&#x2019;t turned on. A light winter wind was blowing a soft, lovely snow into the storm windows. He needed to get out to plow the drive in the morning. He wasn&#x2019;t thinking about that, or the winter, or the storm.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#x2019;d gotten away with it, he thought. That didn&#x2019;t make him much happier.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David &#x2013; he thought of himself as <i>David</i>, rather than Big Dave, Daveareeno, Daveissimo, D-Man, Chips or Bug Boy&#x2013; didn&#x2019;t consider himself a killer. Not a real killer.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was simply accident-prone. Always had been.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accidents were one reason he&#x2019;d been elected as Class of &#x2019;92 funniest boy, like the totally unfunny time when he hadn&#x2019;t gotten the corn chips out of the vending machine in the school&#x2019;s junk-food niche. He&#x2019;d tried to shake the bag loose and the machine had tipped over on him, pinning him to the cold ceramic tiles of Trippton High School.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everybody who&#x2019;d seen it had laughed &#x2013; the fat boy pinned like a spider under a can of peas &#x2013; even before they were sure he wasn&#x2019;t injured.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even George Marx, the assistant principal in charge of discipline, had laughed. He had, nevertheless, given David fifteen days of detention, plus the additional unwanted nickname of Chips, a nickname that had hung on like a bad stink for twenty-five years.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His own father had laughed after he found out that Trippton High School wouldn&#x2019;t make him pay for the damage to the vending machine.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Big Dave, Daveareeno, Daveissimo, D-Man... Bug Boy... squashed like a bug.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The latest accident had occurred that night, though David thought it was all perfectly explainable, if you understood the history and the overall situation. He knew that the cops wouldn&#x2019;t buy it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The history:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, his father was the Bug Man of Trippton, the leading pest exterminator in Buchanan County. For nine months of the year, the brightly-colored Bug Man vans were seen everywhere you&#x2019;d find a bug. For the other three months, in the heart of winter, even the bugs took time off.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David had never been the most popular kid in school and because of his father&#x2019;s rep, had been told to <i>bug off</i> or <i>bug out</i> when he tried to hang with the popular kids, even in elementary school. That&#x2019;d become a tired thirteen-year-long joke in the trek between kindergarten and twelfth grade. He&#x2019;d always laughed about it, trying to ingratiate himself with the Populars.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wasn&#x2019;t laughing, now.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Because, second, Birkmann had fallen in love with Gina Hemming in the summer after sixth grade, when the first freshet of testosterone hit. He&#x2019;d loved her all through school, and for that matter, for his entire life. How, he wondered, could that love have put him here, empty beer can in his hand, a hole in his heart?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hemming had been one of the Populars &#x2013; too smart and arrogant to be the <i>most </i>popular, but right up there, with her gold locket, cashmere sweaters and low-rise fashion jeans. She had a silver ring, with a pearl, in her navel. Her father owned the largest bank in Trippton, which placed her in the local aristocracy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was pretty, if not the prettiest; she had a great body, if not the greatest; and was one of two National Merit Scholars in their class, selected 1992&#x2019;s girl most likely to succeed. People expected great things from her, but, in the way of many small-town girls, the great things hadn&#x2019;t quite come true.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After college, at St. Catherine&#x2019;s in St. Paul, she&#x2019;d gone to work in Washington, D.C., as an aide to a Minnesota congressman. There she learned that being the heiress of Trippton&#x2019;s richest banker didn&#x2019;t cut a whole lot of ice in the nation&#x2019;s capital. Plus, in Washington, she was only in the top twenty percent of pretty, and maybe &#x2013; maybe &#x2013; the top twenty-five percent of good bodies. Those clipboard-carrying aides tended to spend time in the gym, and when that didn&#x2019;t work, on the operating table, getting enhanced.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two years in Washington, she&#x2019;d moved to New York, as an editorial assistant at HarperCollins, and where she needed a solid input of daddy&#x2019;s money to rent a barely livable apartment on the Upper West Side. One day, she was assaulted on a subway to work, or at least that was the way she thought of it, though the guy had only pushed her, probably accidentally.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five years after graduation from college, she&#x2019;d had been back in Trippton, working at daddy&#x2019;s bank. Two years later, she married the scion of the Trippton real estate dynasty, such as it was, in a beautiful eight-bridesmaid ceremony at Trippton National Golf Club, to which David hadn&#x2019;t been invited.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With her good marriage, her father&#x2019;s support, her Washington line of bullshit and New York hair styling, she&#x2019;d advanced quickly enough, from loan officer to vice-president and then to President. When Daddy choked to death on an overcooked slab of roast beef, she got, at age thirty-seven, the whole enchilada.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And at forty-two, had filed for divorce, for reasons not disclosed in the Trippton <i>Republican-River</i>. Rumor had it that the real estate guy, Justin Hart, had taken to wearing nylons and referring to himself as Justine. That would be fine in Washington, New York or L.A., but not so good in Trippton. There were no children.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There she was, David&#x2019;s first and truest love.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Available.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did he love about her? Everything. He loved to hear her talk, he loved to hear her laugh, he loved to watch her walk, he loved the brains and the self-confidence and her whole... gestalt.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> David&#x2019;s own divorce had taken place two years earlier. His ex had promptly moved to Dallas &#x2013; or maybe San Antonio, he got them confused &#x2013; with her lover, to start over with a fresh Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts franchise. She hadn&#x2019;t asked for alimony, only that David purchase her adulterous lover&#x2019;s local Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts store. David had sold off the land on the old family farm, which he&#x2019;d rented out anyway, to get the $250,000 he needed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His ex had taken the cashier&#x2019;s check at a joint meeting with their attorneys, clipped it into her purse, and snarled, &#x201c;I never even <i>liked</i> you, Bug Boy.&#x201d; Then she&#x2019;d looked around the faux-walnut paneling in the law office conference room and asked, &#x201c;How&#x2019;d I ever get stuck in this freezin&#x2019; fuckin&#x2019; mudhole? I must&#x2019;ve been out of my goddamn mind.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> While all that was going on, David had inherited the Bug Man business from his father, who&#x2019;d died of several different kinds of cancer. During most of his career, the old man had considered chlordane, which even smelled kinda good, to be the answer to a bug man&#x2019;s prayers. Turned out, it wasn&#x2019;t. Turned out it was a multi-faceted carcinogen.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After his father&#x2019;s death, David bought out a rival business that had employees trained in the elimination of pest animals &#x2013; rats, skunks and squirrels, mostly, with the occasional raccoon &#x2013; and had changed the company name to GetOut!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At forty-two, he was the undisputed pest-elimination king of Trippton, as well the owner of the only local Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts. There were some in town who considered that a salubrious combination. Others were not so sure; or at least, they hoped he frequently washed his hands.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he was still the Bug Boy.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> All of that had set up the situation that left David crying in front of a blank-screen TV.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gina Hemming, the rich, arrogant, divorced bank Chairwoman of the Board and President of the Second National Bank, and Class of &#x2019;92 girl most likely to succeed, and David Birkmann, financially-okay divorced owner of GetOut! and a Main Street donut shop, &#x2019;92 funniest boy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that cold Thursday night in January, they met at Gina&#x2019;s house with a group of Populars from the class of &#x2019;92, including the class president, homecoming king and queen, the boy and girl most likely to succeed, most athletic boy and girl and funniest boy and girl. A few of the most popular kids had left Trippton and had never returned; they&#x2019;d been invited to the meeting, but had unanimously declined.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group that met Thursday night was to begin working out the mechanisms of the upcoming Twenty-Fifth Reunion of the Trippton High School Class of &#x2019;92 (&#x201c;Go Otters.&#x201d;)<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> One of the committee members, Ryan Harney, a physician, had looked at the faces gathered in Hemming&#x2019;s living room and said, &#x201c;Man &#x2013; the more things change, the more the stay the same, huh?&#x201d; whatever that meant, and later said, &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it weird that we&#x2019;re all still here after twenty-five years?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody seemed to know what that meant, either. Where else would they be?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee sorted through the usual bullshit and passed out assignments: Lucy Cheever, the homecoming queen, now owner of a Chevrolet dealership, agreed to have her computer assistant track down members of the class to get addresses, emails and cell phone numbers; Gina would arrange to get the tent at Trippton National Golf Club for the big second evening reunion; George Brown, the most athletic boy, now owner of a bowling alley, would provide dancing and free beer at the bowling alley on the first &#x201c;fun meet-up&#x201d; night; Birkmann was friendly with the leader of the Dog Butt dance band, which also played softer, more romantic music as June Moon, and agreed to pick up the cost of the band for both nights. Somebody else agreed to collect home movie film and convert it to video for the &#x201c;fun meet-up,&#x201d; and so on.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around eight-thirty, the committee members started drifting away. Ten o&#x2019;clock was bedtime in Trippton, if you wanted to get a good start on the next day. Birkmann, though, had other plans.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#x2019;d gotten ready for the night by dressing carefully, but casually: tan Dockers slacks, high-polished cordovan penny loafers, a button-down checked shirt and green boat-neck sweater, both of the latter from Nordstrom&#x2019;s Rack up at the Mall of America.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he was leaving the house, he&#x2019;d picked up his regular red company hat, but noticed that it had gotten brushed with something black and sticky; no matter, he had a box of them in a variety of colors. He picked a yellow GetOut! baseball cap sprinkled with black dots that, when you looked closely, were deer ticks. Not everybody liked them, but David thought they were cool. And the yellow coordinated nicely with the green sweater and tan Dockers.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Anyway, he&#x2019;d been looking good; casual, but businesslike. When everybody but three committee members had gone, David had gotten his coat and slipped into Hemming&#x2019;s kitchen and out the back door. His truck was parked in the street, with a layer of snow on the windshield.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had stashed a bottle of Barefoot Bubbly Brut Cuvee in his truck, and it was now nice and cold. He&#x2019;d watched the last three members depart, all in the group, saying goodbye to Hemming at the front door. When the last one was gone, he&#x2019;d hustled back up the driveway and in the back door, the bottle of champagne in his hand.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#x2019;d had something casual and sophisticated in mind, but it had all gone bad.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Cut to the action:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Get away from me, you fat fuck!&#x201d; Hemming screamed. She was wearing a burgundy-colored jacket and skirt, with a pale pink blouse and high heels. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re disgusting... you... fuckin&#x2019;... Bug Boy!&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hemming wasn&#x2019;t satisfied with humiliating him, screaming at him and calling him a hated name, she had to go one step further. He&#x2019;d spread his arms, embarrassed enough, trying to quiet her, and she&#x2019;d stepped right up to him and slapped him on the side of the head, raking him with her fingernails. Really put some weight behind it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stunned, he&#x2019;d swung back... not really thinking.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#x2019;d swung with the hand that held the bottle. In the movies, if you hit somebody with a bottle of wine, the bottle broke, and the person went down, and a moment later got up, maybe with a little trickle of blood at the corner of his mouth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he&#x2019;d hit Hemming, the bottle went CLUNK, as though he&#x2019;d hit her with a pipe. The bottle hadn&#x2019;t broken. Hadn&#x2019;t even cracked. Hemming dropped like a head-shot deer.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the next couple of minutes, there was a lot of calling, pleading and shaking &#x2013; &#x201c;Gina, come on, I didn&#x2019;t mean it, get up. Come on, Gina, get up&#x201d; &#x2013; but the fact was, Gina Hemming was deader than the aforesaid deer, looking up at him with blank gray eyes, half open. Gina wouldn&#x2019;t be coming back until she marched in with Jesus and all the saints.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Birkmann hadn&#x2019;t really thought about what to do next, since it wa...</p><h2>The Deepest Grave (Fiona Griffiths Crime Thriller Series)</h2><p><p><b>An ancient battle. A dead researcher. And a very modern crime.</b></p> It's been more than a year since Detective Sergeant Fiona Griffiths had any sort of murder case . . . when all of a sudden, she gets the call. A local archaeologist has been found bloodily murdered. Her head severed from her body. Her eyes apparently fixed on a fragment of Latin text. The crime seems to summon the ghosts of Dark Age Britain - and the shade of King Arthur. But why are those ancient enmities alive once again? Why are armed burglars raiding remote country churches? And how many more people will die before these clues are unravelled? Fiona thinks she knows the answers to these questions . . . but the crime that underlies them all is so utterly unexpected, so breathtakingly audacious in its execution, that it hasn't yet been committed. <strong>This book will be perfect for anyone who's enjoyed the work of Ann Cleeves, Elly Griffiths, or Andrea Camilleri.</strong> <p><b>Praise for the Fiona Griffiths crime thriller series</b></p> <strong>British detective, Fiona Griffiths, is arguably the most compelling female protagonist in contemporary crime fiction / mystery. The series now has thousands of five-star reviews on Goodreads, sales in the hundreds of thousands, a brilliantly succesful TV adaptation - and a rapturous reception from critics.</strong> "So gripping it hurts. A masterpiece."&#x2014;Mark Edwards, author of <em>The Magpies</em> "Gritty, compelling . . . a procedural unlike any other you are likely to read this year."&#x2014;<em>USA Today</em> "With Detective Constable Fiona 'Fi' Griffiths, Harry Bingham . . . finds a sweet spot in crime fiction . . . think Stieg Larsson's Lisbeth Salander . . . Denise Mina's Paddy Meehan [or] Lee Child's Jack Reacher. . . . The writing is terrific."&#x2014;<em>The Boston Globe</em> "The mystery-thriller genre is already so staffed with masterminds that it's hard to make room for another. But along comes a book like <em>Talking to the Dead</em>, and suddenly an unadvertised opening is filled. . . .

The book reveals the full variety of William Orpen's work from his highly accomplished portraits, his revitalization of the nude and the conversation piece, to his extraordinary allegories and war paintings. It analyzes the series of self-portraits, many mocking his own character with a mixture of humor and bitterness, that are a particular feature of his oeuvre. His experiences as an official war artist in France from 1917 to 1919 made him cynical of politicians. Although he painted brilliant portraits of these very men, and of generals and war heroes, he also produced some bitter allegories of war. The war years form the climax of both the book and the exhibition.<br></p><p><b>Robert Upstone</b>, Curator of the exhibition, <b>Roy Foste</b>r, University of Oxford, and <b>David Fraser Jenkins</b>, Senior Curator at the Tate Gallery, London.. <br>&#39;...a highly illustrated monograph on the undeservedly sidelined portraitist...&#39;Daily Telegraph, December 2005.</p><h2>Resistance through rituals: Youth subcultures in post-war Britain (University Library)</h2><p>First published in 1989.

There were all the ingredients to make an Agatha Christie novel: sex, greed, jealousy, resentment.&#34; -Andy Stack, Official Detective Stories Segment seen on 60 Minutes, 1982: &#34;Plague of Justice&#34; Morely Safer interviewing Stan Turel This true crime story includes money, murder and arson investigations, romance, and securities fraud. Greed and manipulation by the diagnosed psychopathic mastermind led to a contract killing. The convicted murderer, in an act of revenge, then sues the victim&#39;s son.Due to the tragic murder of the author&#39;s crippled father in 1974, Stan then in his mid-twenties-became responsible of his father&#39;s estate and took over the role of CEO in his father&#39;s business. Stan privately assisted in the seven- month murder investigation that led to the arrest and conviction of three individuals. Stan was eventually harassed and sued by the convicted CPA (a jailhouse lawyer) for $5,000,000 dollars for his assistance in the murder investigation. Eventually this story was aired on CBS 60 Minutes. Turel is a part-time business consultant still living in Oregon. In his spare time he wants to continue oil painting for fun while working on his next book about two distant cousins, who survived the Holocaust in Poland during World War II.

Tragically, it was not meant to be.<br><br>But what of the son who was born of their passion?<br><br>Gillian Bradshaw gives us a possible answer in <i>Cleopatra's Heir</i>, a riveting historical novel drawn from meticulous research and a unique historical premise. The young son of Julius Caesar and the fabled Cleopatra, Caesarion was seen by some as the hope of the marriage between Rome and Egypt, by others as the folly of a commander's lust for a wanton foreign schemer. For the new Roman ruler, Octavius, Caesarion is the threat that could topple his dreams of a safe and peaceful Roman Empire. <br><br>The brutal truth is that Caesarion could not be allowed to live. But what if he somehow managed to survive the inevitable assassination and went underground to hide his identity? How would he find a way to live when he has always chosen and honor, even though his life has been shadowed by forces greater than anyone should have to cope with? <br><br>Caesarion will travel the lands that he thinks he knows so well only to discover that he knew his people not at all.

He shifted position, trying to ease it, but that only made it worse. He rolled over onto his other side and drew his legs up, then lay still, muzzily aware of himself.It was bakingly hot, and he was thirsty. His tongue hurt. His head hurt. The pain in his right side was like a knife. He was lying on a heap of something rough and hard and uncomfortable. All around him was a dense, hot, purple shade, and a thick, choking smell of myrrh which could not quite drown the competing scents of blood, urine, and hot cotton.He fumbled weakly at the pain in his side, and was rewarded by an exquisite thrust of agony. He moved his hand away again, rubbing swollen fingers together. They were wet.I have had a seizure, he thought guiltily, and I must havefallen on top of something. Mother will be angry. I hope she doesn't punish the slaves.He felt for the fine gold chain around his neck, found it, hauled the little silk bag it held from under his tunic and pressed it against his nose and mouth. Peony root, cardamon, gum ammoniacum, bryony, cinquefoil, and squill: at least the latest remedy <i>smelled</i> nice. He drew in deep breaths of it and tried to remember where he was.Dreamily, he thought of his bedroom in the palace. The floor was always smooth and cool underfoot, even in the hottest summer, and the polished marble was arranged in varicolored patterns, purest white, golden, deep, red-veined green. The bed was of cedarwood, inlaid with gold; in winter the coverlets were of quilted silk, in summer, of brilliantly dyed cotton. There was cool water in an alabaster jar, and a fountain played in the courtyard ...... when he was younger there'd been swimming in the big bath-house, with its pools paved with lapis lazuli, and the water taps that looked like golden dolphins, and the painting on the ceiling of Dionysos covering the pirate ship with vines while the sailors, fleeing into the green waves, were transformed ... the water had felt so cool, so sweet, flowing across his naked flesh, swirling around his legs and arms ...<i>Swimming will aggravate your condition.</i>By Apollo, he was thirsty! Why was he lying here alone? Where were the slaves to fan him, anoint him with scented oils, bring him cool drinks in sweating goblets? Where were the doctors with their potions? Why had he woken up alone? Had he had the seizure somewhere private, where no one could find him? How long had he been lying here?It was so hot. He couldn't think clearly. He had to get out of this purple shade; it was cooking him.Caesarion sat up slowly, holding his sore side, and found himself inhaling purple cotton. He pushed it away feebly, then realized that it was a covering--the awning of his tent, of course; it kept the sun off during the day, it must have fallen down. He turned onto his left side and began to squirm his way awkwardly out from under it, still with one hand clutched protectively over his injured side. Rough sticks of firewood wobbled beneath him, then slipped. He rolled jolting down on top of them into a blaze of sunlight. The pain stabbed red-hot, and he lay still, panting in anguish. Above him the sky was cloudless, colorless from the fury of the sun.He was lying on something knobbly. He looked down and saw that it was one of the guards. The man's throat had been ripped open by a spear-thrust which had broken his jaw, and his tunic was thick with drying blood.Caesarion recoiled, scrambled off hastily, and stood on hot stone, staring down in horror, wiping his left hand convulsively against his tunic. Then his stomach contracted toward his throat. He sank onto his knees and pressed the silk bag to his face again, squeezing his eyes tight shut. No, he thought, No, please, not now, not so soon ... .Nothing happened. No stink of carrion, no overpowering sense of dread, no memories. Only scorching stone against his knees, sun on his head, and the scent of the remedy. The ground was too hot to kneel on. He opened his eyes and stood up.The dead guard was dressed only in his red tunic; his armor, weapons, and cloak were all missing. He lay upon his back,at an angle to the pile of purple-draped firewood. His arms had been at his side until Caesarion had fallen onto him and disarranged them, and one, jolted akimbo, still clutched a chunk of hard journeybread as an offering for the guardian of the Underworld. His eyes were shut, and one of the coins which had been laid upon them shone on the ground by Caesarion's feet. His name, Caesarion remembered, was Megasthenes; he was an Alexandrian of good family, twenty-two years old. He'd been specially selected for this mission because of his loyalty.That loyalty had laid him on his funeral pyre. Caesarion glanced up at it: a stack of firewood, bulked up with camel saddles and grain sacks, piled six feet high and draped in the purple tent awning. He remembered now. Last night (or could it have been the night before last?) he had woken in the dark to the sound of shouting. He had jumped from his bed, fumbled in the dark for his spear, hadn't been able to find it. Someone had burst into the tent with a lantern, and he'd almost struck out before he realized that it was his tutor, Rhodon, who'd stayed behind in Coptos to get news. Rhodon was fully dressed, his normally sleek hair dusty and disheveled, his face pale and his eyes wild. He set down the lantern and grabbed the spear Caesarion had been searching for--it had been propped up by the entrance to the tent. "Here!" he'd shouted loudly. "Here, quickly!"Caesarion had stretched out his hand for the spear--but Rhodon had leveled the point at him. "No," he'd whispered, and their eyes met and held. "Stand still.""Rhodon?" Caesarion had said, unable to take it in."You're not worth my life," Rhodon said, with intense vehemence."You're not worth any more lives. There are already too many dead who were whole and healthy." Then he shouted again, "Here! He's in here! Quickly!"Caesarion remembered screaming in outrage and hurling himself at the traitor--but after that ...Bright, unnaturally vivid fragments: a dead sheep lying on an altar while a priest inspected its entrails; a butterfly fanning its wings on the eye of a corpse; the sound of a flute. There had been an ... interval, and he had woken from it injured.He looked down at himself.A clotted mass of dried blood glued his tunic to his right side, and a fresh red trickle was crawling down onto his knee.I didn't manage to hit him, he realized heavily. He betrayed me to the Romans, and I didn't even manage to hit him--or die nobly. I had a seizure; I was stabbed sometime during the course of it; and I've been lying since in a deep stupor. They thought I was dead. They put me on the top of the pyre, with the dead guard--guards--around me.There was more than one guard, he saw that now. Another pair of feet stuck out from under the purple drapery beside Megasthenes' head. He walked slowly over to the still figure, bent stiffly to lift the covering. It was Eumenes, who'd commanded their small force. His left leg was almost severed, and there were stab wounds in his side and groin. His teeth were clenched and his face was set in an expression of agony; the coins on his eyes looked like beetles eating them. Caesarion replaced the covering with a shaking hand. His knees were trembling and he felt dizzy. He wanted to sit down, but the dead guards took up all the space on the edge of the pyre, and the ground was too hot.There was a third body beyond that of Eumenes. He stumbled over to it, inspected it in turn. Heliodoros, the Cretan, stabbed through the heart. Odd that the mercenary should have died trying to defend Caesarion; he'd made it clear all along that he was only in it for the money. How would he collect his wages now?He stood for a long moment, gazing at the mercenary's face. It was calm, the expression reflecting only a mild surprise. Heliodoros had been a handsome man who'd taken great care of his body, who'd combed his long black hair assiduously every morning and evening. Someone had combed it carefully now, and placed coins upon his eyes. His right hand clasped its chunk of journeybread, and his torn and bloodstained tunic had been carefully straightened. The body, like the other bodies, had not been washed--but then, the camp had been short of water even before an unknown number of the enemy arrived in it. The corpse had been properly anointed: scented oil gleamed on the calm face and made dark splotches on the scarlet tunic. At least Heliodoros and the others were getting a proper funeral.Caesarion lowered the purple awning and raised his eyes to stare vacantly beyond the pyre. Red cliffs, dark, dusty soil, and the merciless desert sky. The sun was high; it must be about noon. Three dead bodies on the pyre. There had been thirty-eight people in the camp, not including himself: two files of royal guardsmen; Eumenes; Eumenes' secretary; Eumenes' valet; Caesarion's secretary and two attendants. Where were all the others? Where were the attackers? Who had arranged this funeral, then abandoned it with the pyre unlit?It was too hot to light a fire now. Probably it had alreadybeen too hot by the time the pyre was arranged, and now they were waiting for nightfall. He turned and looked behind him.The camp his own men had made was still in place, clustered around the stone rim of the cistern which had been dug into the ground by miners a century before. A few scrubby acacias and dead thistles testified that this was a location which occasionally saw water during the winter, but now it was August, and the dry air shimmered like a kiln. The small collection of canvas tents huddled against the base of the near cliff, which provided shade during the worst of the afternoon heat. His own tent, in the center, looked oddly deformed without its upper awning--no, a corner was missing, and the tent had been pegged down lopsided. There were scorch marks on the cloth, just visible through the blur of heat-haze. Rhodon's lantern must have tipped over and set fire to it. The baggage animals--camels, mostly--were tethered a little farther along, and were lying motionless in the puddles of shade at the cliff foot. There were no new tents, but there did seem to be a few more animals, and a collection of military cloaks had been stretched out from the cliff face to provide a little shade, secured to the rocky soil by spears. Shields propped against those spears provided a little more shade, all the shelter that was needed in this hot land. They were tall, oblong shields, red, decorated with unfamiliar motifs. He began to count them, then stopped resignedly. Those were Roman legionary shields, and there would be eighty of them: a full century. A tall standard stood before them, the Roman eagle almost unbearably bright in the noonday sun.The Romans had traveled light, he thought, forcing a numband weary mind to reason about what he could see. No tents, just a few baggage animals to carry food and water for the journey. They had chosen the right equipment and right number for the task they had in hand. They'd known where they were going, and how many men they had to deal with.Rhodon must have sent them a message as soon as the rest of the party left him alone in Coptos. No--even before that: there was not time for a message to have gone from Coptos to Alexandria and a force of men to have sailed up the Nile in response. Rhodon must have sent his message when the royal party itself set off up the Nile. He had waited for the Romans in Coptos, led them up the caravan trail on forced marches--by night, since no one traveled the Eastern Desert by day if he could help it--and brought the enemy into the camp during the hours of darkness. Probably the attack had come just before the dawn, when men slept most deeply. He must have given the password to the sentries, so that no alarm was raised until it was too late. Then he had run to find Caesarion, because he knew that the men would surrender if their king were captured or dead.Eumenes, Megasthenes, and Heliodoros had fought anyway--but perhaps that was just out of confusion, because they'd been woken suddenly by their enemies and didn't know what was going on. The others had indeed surrendered. Rhodon could truthfully claim that he had saved them from exile or death, which was all that they could have expected with Caesarion. There were no Roman bodies on the pyre, which meant that the attackers had succeeded in their mission without losing a man. They would be pleased about that, and would treat their prisoners leniently; they had, in any case, no reasonto hate royal guardsmen who had no royalty left to guard. Probably Rhodon would be richly rewarded. Certainly the Romans <i>ougbt</i> to be grateful to him. He had eliminated a dangerous rival to their emperor, and secured them a chestful of treasure, without the loss of a single man.Caesarion pressed the heels of his hands against his sore eyes. Rhodon had taught him philosophy and mathematics for three years now, and he'd preferred him to all his other tutors. He had <i>liked</i> Rhodon--liked his mordant sense of humor, his honesty, his penetrating mind and elegant wit. <i>You're not worth my life.</i>No, he reasoned silently, passionately; no--but, Rhodon, it wasn't just <i>me</i> that you betrayed. It was all my ancestors as well; it was more! We in Egypt, we were last independent kingdom beside the Middle Sea. Now the Romans have it all. From this day the Greeks are a subject people. It should not have happened without a fight, Rhodon! It should not have happened through Greek treachery!But there was no comfort there: Caesarion had failed, too, as ever. He had not fought: he had had a seizure. Now he was standing beside his own funeral pyre waiting for someone to notice that they'd made a mistake.Were they all asleep? Hadn't they even bothered to post a sentry?He sighed, rubbed his mouth wearily, then stopped and looked at his hand: it was dirty with dried blood which had covered his chin. He moved his tongue furtively in his dry mouth, and, yes, it was stiff and hurt horribly. He must have bitten it during the seizure. A fine figure he would cut when the Romans finally realized their mistake. Here he was, "KingPtolemy Caesar," son of Queen Cleopatra and of the deified Julius--a dirty, bloodstained boy, barely eighteen, unable to speak clearly.Maybe Rhodon was right, and he <i>wasn't</i> worth any more lives. He set his teeth against the all-too-familiar ache of shame. He had <i>always</i> fallen short of what he should have been. It wasn't anything new. He was obliged, still, to continue the struggle. He could not compound his failure by giving up. If he hadn't believed that, he would have killed himself when he first understood that his disease was incurable.Dionysos! How <i>stupid</i>--he hadn't even <i>died</i> when he should. It was like some idiotic comedy, where the hero prolongs his death scene for so long that the rest of the cast pretend to club him over the head and set him on the pyre by force!Except that the Romans <i>still</i> hadn't done so.The Romans must have posted sentries. Romans always posted sentries. Antonius was very emphatic about that, and whatever else he was, the emperor Octavian was competent: he'd proved that by beating Antonius. There was no reason to think the ca...</p><h2>Zorba the Buddha</h2><p>Zorba is not separate from Buddha. The West is not separate from the East.

He was a successful psychologist and writer, with books to his name and bylines in major magazines. But none of that mattered. The impulse to take his own life remained. At times it felt all but inescapable.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bering survived. And in addition to relief, the fading of his suicidal thoughts brought curiosity. Where had they come from? Would they return? Is the suicidal impulse found in other animals? Or is our vulnerability to suicide a uniquely human evolutionary development? In <i>Suicidal</i>, Bering answers all these questions and more, taking us through the science and psychology of suicide, revealing its cognitive secrets and the subtle tricks our minds play on us when we&#x2019;re easy emotional prey. Scientific studies, personal stories, and remarkable cross-species comparisons come together to help readers critically analyze their own doomsday thoughts while gaining broad insight into a problem that, tragically, will most likely touch all of us at some point in our lives. But while the subject is certainly a heavy one, Bering&#x2019;s touch is light. Having been through this himself, he knows that sometimes the most effective response to our darkest moments is a gentle humor, one that, while not denying the seriousness of suffering, at the same time acknowledges our complicated, flawed, and yet precious existence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Authoritative, accessible, personal, profound&#x2014;there&#x2019;s never been a book on suicide like this. It will help you understand yourself and your loved ones, and it will change the way you think about this most vexing of human problems.</p><p><b>Jesse Bering </b>is the author of <i>Perv: The Sexual Deviant in All of Us</i>, <i>Why Is the Penis Shaped Like That?</i>, and <i>The Belief Instinct</i>. He is the director of the Centre for Science Communication at the University of Otago in New Zealand.<br> &nbsp;"What undergirds Bering's inquiry is the belief that locating the psychological blunders that lead to suicide can help, in time, to curb their prevalence." (<i>New Yorker</i>)<br><br>"He weaves together personal stories, delves into whether nonhuman animals die by suicide, and examines the relation of religion and self-killing. These angles offer a critical perspective on a devastating problem."<br> &nbsp; (<i>Scientific American</i>)<br><br>"Suicide is one of the toughest subjects to write about, and psychologist Jesse Bering does it with candor, scientific integrity and genuine empathy in&nbsp;<i>Suicidal</i><i>. </i>. . . &nbsp;The book itself is a testament to the human spirit. Researching and writing the book, he says, was a way to combat suicidal ideation and give his own life a renewed sense of purpose. . . . <i>Suicidal </i>is a vital book--informative, engaging, and enlightening despite its dark subject matter." (<i>Shelf Awareness</i>)<br><br>"Jesse Bering is the best science writer at work today."<br> &nbsp; (Dan Savage)<br><br>"By the time you finish reading these sentences someone in the world will have committed suicide. Why do more than a million people a year kill themselves? To answer this question we need a brilliant research scientist, an insightful psychologist, and a sensitive but powerful writer who has seriously contemplated taking their own life. Jesse Bering fits all three criteria and the book you hold in your hands is a deeply moving narrative that cuts to the heart of the ultimate question any of us could ever ask: why should I live? Given what&#x2019;s at stake in the topic, <i>Suicidal </i>may very well be the most important book you will ever read." (Michael Shermer, publisher of Skeptic Magazine)<br><br>"I'm not surprised that a book on suicide would be very personal, but I didn&#x2019;t expect it to be so damn funny. It's also engaging, thoughtful, and sensitive--although Bering is certainly irreverent, there is a real appreciation of how painful and difficult this topic can be. This is a book for scholars and for a general audience, but it is also entirely suitable for people whose lives have been touched by the suicide of someone they loved." (Paul Bloom, author of Against Empathy)<br><br>"In&nbsp;<i>Suicidal,&nbsp;</i>Jesse Bering explores one of the most essential questions we all face: Why keep living? He doesn't claim to have found any easy answers, but his exploration is surprising, funny, touching, and deeply personal.&nbsp;<i>Suicidal</i>&nbsp;feels like a gift, and reading it reminded me that encounters with great books are reason enough, for now, to keep going." (Christopher Ryan, author of Sex at Dawn)<br><br>"I have yet to come away from reading one of [Bering's] essays and not feel considerably better informed than I was just minutes before."

Only in Hong Kong would a man at a cocktail party pick up a woman with the line "What do you think of the dollar?" And only in <i>Video Night in Kathmandu</i> will you find detailed, unsettling portraits of a Far East in flux as experienced by Pico Iyer, a travel writer beyond compare. Tibet, China, India, and Thailand--these are among the objects of Iyer's wanderlust, the subjects of 11 essays chronicling his travels. In India, he explores the lucrative Bombay film business: "The process of turning an American movie into an Indian one was not very difficult ... but it did require a few changes.... the Indian hero had to be domesticated, supplied with a father, a mother, and a clutch of family complications." As one film director told him, " ... for example, Rambo must be given a sister who was raped." In Bangkok he finds the sex trade is well nigh impossible to avoid: " ... by the time a third official government tout approached me with the novel invitation: 'My friend. You no like birdwatching?' I was inclined to suspect that ornithology was not among his interests." <p> Pico Iyer is more than just a travel writer. For four years, he wrote about world affairs for <i>Time</i>, and he brings to these brilliant, comical, and poignant essays his extensive knowledge of politics and culture as well as a journalist's eye for the telling details. <i>Video Night in Kathmandu</i> provides both a stark, unsettling view of modern Asia and an exploration of the ambivalent attitudes Asians hold toward the West.</p>11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Primary Mathematics, 3B: Teacher&#39;s Guide, Standards Edition</h2><p>Primary Mathematics, 3B: Teacher&#39;s Guide.

His ten masterpieces, created against the backdrop of a continent in severe political and cultural upheaval, constitute an unmatched body of work. A man who spent most of his life in abject poverty, inspiring both critical derision and hysterical hero-worship, Wagner was a walking contradiction: belligerent, flirtatious, disciplined, capricious, demanding, visionary, and poisonously anti-Semitic. Acclaimed biographer Simon Callow evokes the intellectual and artistic climate in which Wagner lived and takes us through his most iconic works, from his pivotal successes in <i>The Flying Dutchman</i> and <i>Lohengrin</i>, to the musical paradigm shift contained in <i>Tristan and Isolde</i>, to the apogee of his achievements in <i>The Ring of the Nibelung</i> and <i>Parsifal</i>, which debuted at Bayreuth shortly before his death. <i>Being Wagner</i> brings to life this towering figure, creator of the most sublime and most controversial body of work ever known.</p><p><b>Simon Callow</b>&nbsp;made his stage debut in 1973 and came to prominence in a critically acclaimed performance as Mozart in the original stage production of Peter Shaffer&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Amadeus</i>&nbsp;at the Royal National Theatre in 1979. He is well known for a series of one-man shows that have toured internationally and featured subjects such as Charles Dickens, Oscar Wilde, William Shakespeare, Jesus, and Richard Wagner. Among his many film roles is the much-loved character Gareth in the hit film&nbsp;<i>Four Weddings and a Funeral</i>. Callow has simultaneously pursued careers as a director in theater and opera and is an author of several books, including&nbsp;<i>Being an Actor</i>,&nbsp;<i>Love Is Where It Falls</i>, and a biography of&nbsp;Charles Laughton.VORSPIEL<br> &nbsp;<br> On 26 August 1876, as the last notes of the first performance of <i>The Twilight of the Gods </i>died away in the newly built Festspielhaus, in the tiny Bavarian town of Bayreuth, 2,000 people sat shaken, inspired, enchanted &#x2013; or appalled. Among them were the musical aristocracy of Europe: Liszt, Saint- Sa�ns, Tchaikovsky, Anton Rubinstein, Grieg and Bruckner, along with a good sprinkling of the actual aristocracy of Europe, two emperors, three kings, a handful of princes, two grand dukes. All of them, or almost all of them, were swept along on a cataclysm of emotion to equal anything that happened on stage that evening.<br> &nbsp;<br>As the applause grew and grew, and before singers or conductor or designer or choreographer had appeared in front of the curtain to acknowledge it, a diminutive, stooping figure, familiar not just to the faithful but to the cultured world at large, the subject of a dozen photoshoots, two dozen portraits and a thousand cartoons, made his way somewhat lopsidedly to the front of the stage; his disproportionately huge head with its madly bulging eyes was topped by a floppy velvet cap set at a rakish angle. This man, this tiny man, sixty-three years old, but looking, Tchaikovsky thought, ancient and frail, was the hero of the hour, the sole architect of the vast four-day, fifteen-hour epic, every one of whose thousands and thousands of words and thousands and thousands of notes he had created, unleashing onto the vast stage gods and dwarves, dragons and songbirds, women warriors on horseback and maidens disporting themselves in the Rhine, digging deeply and unsettlingly into the subconscious, discharging in his audience emotions that were oceanic and engulfing &#x2013; this man was the architect of all that; the architect, indeed, in all but name, of the very theatre in which the heaving, roaring audience sat. There he stood before them, the self-proclaimed Musician of the Future. He held a hand up, and in the ensuing silence, in the marked Saxon accent which he never made the slightest attempt to lose, he said: &#x2018;Now you&#x2019;ve seen what I want to achieve in Art. And you&#x2019;ve seen what my artists, what we, can achieve. If you want the same thing, we shall have an Art.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> That was the way he spoke.<br> &nbsp;<br> By we, he meant, of course, the German people. The first, the most important thing he had to say, was that the great work he had brought into existence was, above all else, German.<br> &nbsp;<br> At a celebratory banquet the following night, after an interminable and obscure speech by a Reichstag deputy, the Hungarian politician Count Albert Apponyi leaped to his feet unannounced and said:<br> &nbsp;<br> Br�nnhilde &#x2013; the new national art &#x2013; lay asleep on a rock, surrounded by a great fire. The god Wotan had lit this fire, so that only the victorious and fi nest hero, a hero who knew no fear, would win her as his bride. Around the rock were mountains of ash and clinker &#x2013; the cross-breeding of our own music with non-German elements. Along came a hero, the like of whom had never been seen before, Richard Wagner, who forged a weapon from the fragments of the sword of his fathers &#x2013; the classical German masters &#x2013; and with this sword he penetrated the fire, and with his kiss he awoke the sleeping Br�nnhilde. &#x2018;Hail to you, victorious light!&#x2019; she cried and with her we join our voices: &#x2018;Three cheers to our master, Richard Wagner! Hip hip! Hip hip! Hip hip!&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> So that was it: Wagner was the hero of the newly unified German Reich, which had come into being just five years earlier, and his music was its music. Many people, including many Germans, felt very uncomfortable about this new Germany, and <i>The Ring of the Nibelung </i>seemed to embody, in its grandiosity, its self-celebrating Teutonic tub-thumping, its primitivism, everything that worried them about it. Wagner himself, after a brief and unsuccessful flirtation with the masters of the new establishment, was already somewhat unenamored of their policies: to his immeasurable disgust, one of Reichskanzler Bismarck&#x2019;s first acts had been to give the vote to Jews. Wagner also, more surprisingly, loathed the new climate of militarism and imperialism. He withdrew back into the kingdom of art where he would always be absolute monarch, where his will would always prevail, where he could explore the depths and the heights of human experience &#x2013; by which he meant, of course, his own experience.<br> &nbsp;<br> None of this &#x2013; Wagner&#x2019;s creation of a new national art, his acclaim as the greatest German artist of his times, the creation of his custom-built theatre &#x2013; could possibly have been predicted at any point in the composer&#x2019;s life up to that point. It was, to be sure, exactly what he set out to do, almost to the letter. But there was nothing inevitable about it whatever. The massive solidity of his achievement grew out of and existed in the face of profound instability, both internal and external, an instability which characterizes every stage and every phase of his life and which indeed is at the very heart of his music. At every turn of the way, his vision, and he was nothing if not visionary, was in danger of being sabotaged, either by circumstances, or by other people, or &#x2013; more often than not &#x2013; by himself.<br> &nbsp;<br> We know all this because he told us. We know everything about this extraordinary man, everything, that is, except the most important thing: how he created his music. Because even he, the great motor-mouth, the obsessive self-analyst, was unable to explain that. But everything else, we know. Not just because of the memoirs, the reviews, the police records, the biographies, but because, in a way unusual in a musician &#x2013; almost unknown, in fact &#x2013; he was driven to communicate verbally, to explain himself in conversation, in letters, in speeches, in diaries, in pamphlets, in books. He wrote about art, music, theatre, history, politics, race, language, anthropology, myth, philosophy. Above all he wrote about himself. All this self-centeredness was not simple egomania, though it was that too. It was how he engaged with his creativity.<br> &nbsp;<br> Before he could compose a note he needed to articulate his position, to formulate his philosophy, to put himself in relation to the work and to the world &#x2013; to dramatize himself as an artist, one might say. And for those who were susceptible, this torrent of words and this vision of himself was bewitching &#x2013; positively hypnotic. For others (including some of his closest associates) it was unnerving, dangerous, overwhelming, almost life-threatening. His production of himself was inextinguishable. Many people tried to stop him, to suppress him, to silence him. Nothing but death could stem the flow. Where did it all come from? What was going on inside Wagner&#x2019;s head?</p><h2>How to Beat the Salary Trap</h2><p>How to Beat the Salary Trap</p><p></p><h2>The Pentagon&#39;s New Map: War and Peace in the Twenty-First Century</h2><p>A former senior military analyst with the U.S.Naval War College offers a thought-provoking analysis of the United States and global security that utilizes recent military history and strategy; economic, political, and cultural factors; and foreign policy and security issues to examine the future of war and peace, as well as America&#39;s role in the international community. 100,000 first printing. 100,000 first printing.</p><p>This bold and important book strives to be a practical "strategy for a Second American Century." In this brilliantly argued work, Thomas Barnett calls globalization "this country&#x2019;s gift to history" and explains why its wide dissemination is critical to the security of not only America but the entire world. As a senior military analyst for the U.S. Naval War College, Barnett is intimately familiar with the culture of the Pentagon and the State Department (both of which he believes are due for significant overhauls). He explains how the Pentagon, still in shock at the rapid dissolution of the once evil empire, spent the 1990s grasping for a long-term strategy to replace containment. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Barnett argues, revealed the gap between an outdated Cold War-era military and a radically different one needed to deal with emerging threats. He believes that America is the prime mover in developing a "future worth creating" not because of its unrivaled capacity to wage war, but due to its ability to ensure security around the world. Further, he believes that the U.S. has a moral responsibility to create a better world and the way he proposes to do that is by bringing all nations into the fold of globalization, or what he calls connectedness. Eradicating disconnectedness, therefore, is "the defining security task of our age." His stunning predictions of a U.S. annexation of much of Latin America and Canada within 50 years as well as an end to war in the foreseeable future guarantee that the book will be controversial. And that's good. <i>The Pentagon's New Map</i> deserves to be widely discussed. Ultimately, however, the most impressive aspects of the book is not its revolutionary ideas but its overwhelming optimism. Barnett wants the U.S. to pursue the dream of global peace with the same zeal that was applied to preventing global nuclear war with the former Soviet Union. High-level civilian policy makers and top military leaders are already familiar with his vision of the future&#x2014;this book is a briefing for the rest of us and it cannot be ignored. --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i><p>Thomas P.

Now this funny, haunting modern myth is presented with Bedford&#39;s wonderful illustrations, which first appeared in the author&#39;s own day, have long been out of print, and have never been equaled.</p><p>"All children, except one, grow up." Thus begins a great classic of children's literature that we all remember as magical. What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as "Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds," and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including "embonpoint," "quietus," and "pluperfect." Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, for <i>Peter Pan</i> has a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are "literary" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as "youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg," and the author interjects: "This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form." A book for adult readers-aloud to revel in--and it just might teach young listeners to fly.

To his contemporaries he was a minor disciple of Emerson; he has since joined the ranks of America's most respected and beloved writers. Few, however, really know the complexity of the man they revere &#x2014; wanderer and scholar, naturalist and humorist, teacher and surveyor, abolitionist and poet, Transcendentalist and anthropologist, inventor and social critic, and, above all, individualist.<br>In this widely acclaimed biography, outstanding Thoreau scholar Walter Harding presents all of these Thoreaus. Scholars will find here the culmination of a lifetime of research and study, meticulously documented; general readers will find an absorbing story of a remarkable man. Writing always with supreme clarity, Professor Harding has marshaled all the facts so as best to "let them speak for themselves." Thoreau's thoughtfulness and stubbornness, his more than ordinarily human amalgam of the earthy and the sublime, his unquenchable vitality emerge to the reader as they did to his own family, friends, and critics.<br>You will see Thoreau's work in his family's pencil factory, his accidental setting of a forest fire, his love of children and hatred of hypocrisy, his contributions to the scientific understanding of forest trees, and other more and less familiar aspects of the man and his works. You will find the social as well as the reclusive Thoreau. Reactions to him by such notable contemporaries as Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Walt Whitman &#x2014; with Thoreau's responses to them &#x2014; are given in rich detail.<br>The totality is as complete, accurate, fair, vivid, and fully rounded a portrait as has ever been drawn. On its appearance, Professor Harding's work immediately established itself as "the standard biography" (Edward Wagenknecht). It has never been superseded. For this Dover edition, the author has corrected minor errors, provided an appendix bibliographically documenting hundreds of facts, and contributed an Afterword updating some of his findings and discussing Thoreau scholarship.</p><p><em>Walter Harding</em> is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of American Literature at the State University of New York at Geneseo."[T]he best biography we have had."<b>--Carl Bode, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><h2>The Story of Saint Patrick&#39;s Day</h2><p>The story begins with the traditional symbols of the day that are often found in schoolrooms, such as shamrocks, harps, and leprechauns.

At the time of the Second Vatican Council a new order of Mass was approved (the New Rite, or <i>Novus Ordo</i>) which was regularly to be said in English only, with a Latin version for occasional use. Now two important developments have taken place. Before long both a new Roman Missal and a new Lectionary will be published and The Holy Father has also encouraged and authorized the widespread usage of the Old Rite&#x2015; also known as The Tridentine Rite or the Latin Mass. </b><br><b>Accordingly, this new publication is of the Missal in its 1962 edition, which was authorized by Pope John XXIII before the start of The Second Vatican Council. It is therefore the last authorized version of the Tridentine rite. This new edition of <i>The Layman's Missal</i> does, however, include one change &#x2015; the version of the Prayer for the Jews which has been amended by Pope Benedict XVI and is now promulgated for use.</b></p></p><p>"An excellent introduction to the more ancient form of the sacred liturgy." - <em>Catholic Herald</em><br><br>Mention - <em>Church Times</em>, 9 April 2009</p><h2>The Scale of Perfection (Middle English Texts)</h2><p>Walter Hilton&#39;s The Scale of Perfection maintains a secure place among the major religious treatises composed in fourteenth-century England. This guide to the contemplative life, written in two books of more than 40,000 words each, is notable for its careful explorations of its religious themes and also as a monument of Middle English prose. Its popularity is attested by the fact that some forty-two manuscripts containing one or both of the books survive, with a relatively large number of manuscipts with Book I alone, which suggests it may have been the more popular of the two. Hilton (born c. 1343) was a member of the religious order known as the Augustinian Canons. There is reason to believe that be was trained in canon law and studied at the University of Cambridge. He was the author of a number of works in English and Latin, all much shorter than The Scale. He died at the Augustinian Priory of Thurgarton in Nottinghamshire in 1396. On the basis of the content of certain of his works it can be safely inferred that he was actively involved in some of the religious controversies current in England in the 1380s and 1390s, and his principal concern, evident in The Scale , is to defend orthodox belief, especially in the conduct of the contemplative life.</p><p>Walter Hilton (d. 1396) was an English Augustinian mystic. He attended Cambridge University, and at some point, probably before 1386, he rejected the legal and administrative career available to him and retired from the world as a hermit. Later he decided that his true vocation was not to the heremitic life, but to a religious order. According to manuscript tradition, Hilton died as an Augustinian Canon Regular in the priory of St. Peter at Thurgarton in Nottinghamshire. His spiritual writings were widely influential during the fifteenth century in England.Text: English</p><h2>Reasonable Doubts (Guido Guerrieri)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Carofiglio writes crisp, ironical novels that are as much love stories and philosophical treatises as they are legal thrillers.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New Yorker</i></p><p>&#x201c;Guerrieri could have just gotten off an Alitalia flight from the land of Grisham or the Los Angeles of Michael Connelly&#x2019;s <i>The Lincoln Lawyer</i>.

When she is confronted with two evil killers there is only one man who can save her - Bond himself.</p><p><p>Ian Fleming (1908-1964), creator of the world's best-known secret agent, is the author of fourteen James Bond books. Born in London in 1908 and educated at Eton and Sandhurst, he became the Reuters Moscow correspondent in 1929. In the spring of 1939, Fleming went back to Moscow as a special correspondent for the <b>London Times</b>. In June of that same year, he joined Naval Intelligence and served throughout World War II, finally earning the rank of Commander, RNVSR (Sp.). Much of the James Bond material was drawn directly from Fleming's experiences as an intelligence officer. Later, Fleming became a consultant on foreign affairs for the <b>London Sunday Times</b>, by which time he had become far better known as the creator of James Bond.</p><p>1. SCAREDY CAT</p> <p>I was running away. I was running away from England, from my childhood, from the winter, from a sequence of untidy, unattractive love-affairs, from the few sticks of furniture and jumble of overworn clothes that my London life had collected around me; and I was running away from drabness, fustiness, snobbery, the claustrophobia of close horizons and from my inability, although I am quite an attractive rat, to make headway in the rat-race. In fact, I was running away from almost everything except the law.</p> <p>And I had run a very long way indeed - almost, exaggerating a bit, halfway round the world. In fact, I had come all the way from London to The Dreamy Pines Motor Court which is ten miles west of Lake George, the famous American tourist resort in the Adirondacks - that vast expanse of mountains, lakes and pine forests which forms most of the northern territory of New York State. I had started on September 1st, and it was now Friday October 13th. When I had left, the grimy little row of domesticated maples in my square had been green, or as green as any tree can be in London in August. Now, in the billion-strong army of pine trees that marched away northwards towards the Canadian border, the real, wild maples flamed here and there like shrapnel-bursts. And I felt that I, or at any rate my skin, had changed just as much - from the grimy sallowness that had been the badge of my London life to the snap and colour and sparkle of living out of doors and going to bed early and all those other dear dull things that had been part of my life in Quebec before it was decided that I must go to England and learn to be a 'lady'. Very unfashionable, of course, this cherry-ripe, strength-through-joy complexion, and I had even stopped using lipstick and nail varnish, but to me it had been like sloughing off a borrowed skin and getting back into my own, and I was childishly happy and pleased with myself whenever I looked in the mirror (that's another thing - I'll never say 'looking-glass' again; I just don't have to any more) and found myself not wanting to paint a different face over my own. I'm not being smug about this. I was just running away from the person I'd been for the past five years. I wasn't particularly pleased with the person I was now, but I had hated and despised the other one, and I was glad to be rid of her face.</p> <p>Station WOKO (they might have dreamed up a grander call-sign!) in Albany, the capital of New York State and about fifty miles due south of where I was, announced that it was six o'clock. The weather report that followed included a storm warning with gale-force winds. The storm was moving down from the north and would hit Albany around 8pm. That meant that I would be having a noisy night. I didn't mind. Storms don't frighten me, and although the nearest living soul, as far as I knew, was ten miles away up the not very good secondary road to Lake George, the thought of the pines that would soon be thrashing outside, the thunder and lightning and rain, made me already feel snug and warm and protected in anticipation. And alone! But above all alone! 'Loneliness becomes a lover, solitude a darling sin.' Where had I read that? Who had written it? It was so exactly the way I felt, the way that, as a child, I had always felt until I had forced myself to 'get into the swim', 'be one of the crowd' -a good sort, on the ball, hep. And what a hash I had made of 'togetherness'! I shrugged the memory of failure away. Everyone doesn't have to live in a heap. Painters, writers, musicians are lonely people. So are statesmen and admirals and generals. But then, I added to be fair, so are criminals and lunatics. Let's just say, not to be too flattering, that true individuals are lonely. It's not a virtue, the reverse if anything. One ought to share and communicate if one is to be a useful member of the tribe. The fact that I was so much happier when I was alone was surely the sign of a faulty, a neurotic character. I had said this so often to myself in the past five years that now, that evening, I just shrugged my shoulders and, hugging my solitude to me, walked across the big lobby to the door and went out to have a last look at the evening.</p> <p>I hate pine trees. They are dark and stand very still and you can't shelter under them or climb them. They are very dirty, with a most un-treelike black dirt, and if you get this dirt mixed with their resin they make you really filthy. I find their jagged shapes vaguely inimical, and the way they mass so closely together gives me the impression of an army of spears barring my passage. The only good thing about them is their smell, and, when I can get hold of it, I use pine-needle essence in my bath. Here, in the Adirondacks, the endless vista of pine trees was positively sickening. They clothe every square yard of earth in the valleys and climb up to the top of every mountain so that the impression is of a spiky carpet spread to the horizon -an endless vista of rather stupid-looking green pyramids waiting to be cut down for matches and coat-hangers and copies of the New York Times.</p> <p>Five acres or so of these stupid trees had been cleared to build the motel, which is all that this place really was.' Motel' isn't a good word any longer. It has become smart to use 'Motor Court' or 'Ranch Cabins' ever since motels became associated with prostitution, gangsters and murders, for all of which their anonymity and lack of supervision is a convenience. The site, tourist-wise, in the lingo of the trade, was a good one. There was this wandering secondary road through the forest, which was a pleasant alternative route between Lake George and Glens Falls to the south, and halfway along it was a small lake, cutely called Dreamy Waters, that is a traditional favourite with picnickers. It was on the southern shore of this lake that the motel had been built, its reception lobby facing the road with, behind this main building, the rooms fanning out in a semi-circle. There were forty rooms with kitchen, shower and lavatory, and they all had some kind of a view of the lake behind them. The whole construction and design was the latest thing - glazed pitch-pine front-ages and pretty timber roofs all over knobbles, air-conditioning, television in every cabin, children's playground, swimming pool, golf range out over the lake with floating balls (fifty balls, one dollar) - all the gimmicks. Food? Cafeteria in the lobby, and grocery and liquor deliveries twice a day from Lake George. All this for ten dollars single and sixteen double. No wonder that, with around two hundred thousand dollars' capital outlay and a season lasting only from July 1st to the beginning of October, or, so far as the NO VACANCY sign was concerned, from July 14th to Labour Day, the owners were finding the going hard. Or so those dreadful Phanceys had told me when they'd taken me on as receptionist for only thirty dollars a week plus keep. Thank heavens they were out of my hair! Song in my heart? There had been the whole heavenly choir at six o'clock that morning when their shiny station wagon had disappeared down the road on their way to Glens Falls and then to Troy where the monsters came from. Mr Phancey had made a last grab at me and I hadn't been quick enough. His free hand had run like a fast lizard over my body before I had crunched my heel into his instep. He had let go then. When his contorted face had cleared, he said softly, 'All right, sex-box. Just see that you mind camp good until the boss comes to take over the keys tomorrow midday. Happy dreams tonight.' Then he had grinned a grin I hadn't understood, and had gone over to the station-wagon where his wife had been watching from the driver's seat. 'Come on, Jed,' she had said sharply. 'You can work off those urges on West Street tonight.' She put the car in gear and called over to me sweetly, ' 'Bye now, cutie-pie. Write us every day.' Then she had wiped the crooked smile off her face and I caught a last glimpse of her withered, hatchet profile as the car turned out on to the road. Phew! What a couple! Right out of a book - and what a book! Dear Diary! Well, people couldn't come much worse, and now they'd gone. From now on, on my travels, the human race must improve!</p> <p>I had been standing there, looking down the way the Phanceys had gone, remembering them. Now I turned and looked to the north to see after the weather. It had been a beautiful day, Swiss clear and hot for the middle of October, but now high fretful clouds, black with jagged pink hair from the setting sun, were piling down the sky. Fast little winds were zigzagging among the forest tops and every now and then they hit the single yellow light above the deserted gas station down the road at the tail of the lake and set it swaying. When a longer gust reached me, cold and buffeting, it brought with it the whisper of a metallic squeak from the dancing light, and the first time this happened I shivered deliciously at the little ghostly noise. On the lake shore, beyond the last of the cabins, small waves were lapping fast against the stones and the gun-metal surface of the lake was fretted with sudden cats&#x2019; paws that sometimes showed a fleck of white. But, in between the angry gusts, the air was still, and the sentinel trees across the road and behind the motel seemed to be pressing silently closer to huddle round the camp-fire of the brightly-lit building at my back.</p> <p>I suddenly wanted to go to the loo, and I smiled to myself. It was the piercing tickle that comes to children during hide-and-seek-in-the dark and 'Sardines', when, in your cupboard under the stairs, you heard the soft creak of a floorboard, the approaching whisper of the searchers. Then you clutched yourself in thrilling anguish and squeezed your legs together and waited for the ecstasy of discovery, the crack of light from the opening door and then - the supreme moment - your urgent' Ssh! Come in with me!', the softly closing door and the giggling warm body pressed tight against your own.</p> <p>Standing there, a 'big girl' now, I remembered it all and recognised the sensual itch brought on by a...</p></p><h2>Robots and empire</h2><p>Long after his humiliating defeat at the hands of Earthman Elijah Baley, Keldon Amadiro embarked on a plan to destroy planet Earth.

It provides a theoretical framework based on cognitive-behavioral principles and integrates these in a developmentally sensitive way. Thus, play as well as verbal and nonverbal approaches are used in resolving problems. CBPT differs from nondirective play therapy, which avoids any direct discussion of the child&#39;s difficulties. A specific problem-solving approach is utilized, which helps the child develop more adaptive thoughts and behaviors. Cognitive-behavioral therapies are based on the premise that cognitions determine how people feel and act, and that faulty cognitions can contribute to psychological disturbance. Cognitive-behavioral therapies focus on identifying maladaptive thoughts, understanding the assumptions behind the thoughts, and learning to correct or counter the irrational ideas that interfere with healthy functioning. Since their development approximately twenty-five years ago, such therapies have traditionally been used with adults and only more recently with adolescents and children. It has commonly been thought that preschool-age and school-age children are too young to understand or correct distortions in their thinking. However, the recent development of CBPT reveals that cognitive strategies can be used effectively with young children if treatments are adapted in order to be developmentally sensitive and attuned to the child&#39;s needs. For example, while the methods of cognitive therapy can be communicated to adults directly, these may need to be conveyed to children indirectly, through play activities. In particular, puppets and stuffedanimals can be very helpful in modeling the use of cognitive strategies such as countering irrational beliefs and making positive self-statements. CBPT is structured and goal oriented and intervention is directive in nature. It incorporates empirically demonstrated cognitive and behavioral techniques and allows for the empirical examination of treatment outcome. This long-awaited volume will be useful to clinicians of every theoretical persuasion in enabling them to formulate fresh approaches for helping their young patients.<b>Susan M.

TV tie-in. 15,000 first printing. First serial, Destination Discovery.</p><p>While the 50th anniversary of D-day is being commemorated in many ways, few will be as affecting as the episodic journal of Marie Osmont, an aristocratic Frenchwoman who endured four comparatively pacific years of German occupation and three hellish months of liberation. Her chronicle, the centerpiece of a TV documentary to be broadcast by the Discovery Channel in June, offers a vividly detailed account of what it was like to be a noncombatant caught near Ground Zero when Allied forces made their long-awaited assault on Hitler's Festung Europa. At the time of the invasion, the widowed Osmont was mistress of Ch&#x192;teau P&#x201a;riers, a sizable Normandy estate about three miles inland from Sword Beach, where British Tommies landed in the early dawn of June 6, 1944. Although Boche soldiers were billeted in and around her home for nearly four years, she kept only sporadic records until the beginning of 1944. In the grim aftermath of Operation Overlord, however, her diary literally comes alive. A thoroughgoing patrician imbued with the spirit of noblesse oblige, the author reveals herself in print as a very human being. Appalled by the manifest horrors of war, she grieves for cyclamens crushed under the treads of advancing armor, fine old trees lost to fortification builders, and livestock slaughtered in the artillery duels that ravaged her demesne, as well as the civilian friends who were killed, wounded, or dispossessed in the fierce fighting. Osmont also proves an acute observer of alien social mores and appreciates the cosmic irony of death and destruction being visited upon rural innocents in the midst of an achingly beautiful summer. Her annals stop abruptly in mid-August of 1944, and the text at hand offers no clue as to her immediate or eventual fate. Eloquent testimony for posterity, reminding us that military campaigns, however just, have awful costs. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The author was a middle-aged French widow living in a chateau only three miles inland from the Normandy invasion beaches. Her remarkable diary records her impressions during the German occupation, the D-Day fighting and the subsequent occupation by British troops. Profoundly resentful of the uninvited military guests who made themselves at home at Chateau Periers, Osmont could not bring herself to hate the Germans and, in fact, felt maternal pity for the youngest infantrymen. Though she achieved greater rapport with the British commandos who violently replaced them after D-Day, she soon became disgusted by their rampant thievery and vandalism (they "plunder idiotically") and, when a neighbor characterized the British as their saviors, Madame replied, "But at what a price!" Her comments often touch one's emotions as she bewails the damage to her cherished chateau in the furious fighting, tenderly cares for terrified stray animals and grieves over the fresh graves of German and British soldiers she had known. Her descriptions of the bombardments, air raids and firefights are vivid and disturbing (she was struck by shrapnel on the second day of battle but carried on after treatment). A unique account of the Normandy invasion by a perceptive observer caught in the action.

From adolescence on, she indulged in sadistic lesbian fantasies, and by middle age, had regressed to a mirror-fixated state of pathological necro-sadism involving witchcraft, torture, blood-drinking, and more.

An authentic story, hitherto unpublished in its horrific entirety anywhere. The documents concerning it are extremely difficult to get hold of, for it all happened more than three and a half centuries ago in a savage Hungary which today lies behind the Iron Curtain. Relevant documents passed from one archive to another. No one knows what has happened since 1956 to the Hungarian archives which were kept in Budapest Castle. Where would one go to see the sombre portrait with the haggard eyes of the very beautiful Erzs&#x201a;bet Bathory? For the last two hundred years Csejthe Castle has lain in ruins on its rocky spur of the Lesser Carpathians on the frontier of Slovalda. But the ghost and the vampires remain, and so does that earthenware pot which used to contain the blood which was about to be poured over the shoulders of the Countess; that is still there in a comer of the cellars. The Beast of Csejthe, the bloody Countess, still shrieks in the night, in that very room whose door and windows were, and still remain, walled up. There is every indication that she was a female Gilles de Rais; even the hasty trial in which, out of respect for a name illustrious since the birth of Hungary, and because of those services rendered by her family to the Hapsburgs, so many facts were suppressed. It was even judged imprudent to interrogate her personally. The minutes of the trial were discovered in 1729 by a Jesuit Father, Laszl Tur&nbsp;czi, who wrote a monograph on Erzs&#x201a;bet Bathory, to be published in 1744. He gathered together a story that no one in the region of Csejthe has ever forgotten. Moreover, Tur&nbsp;czi had access to documents first preserved in the archives of the Court of Vienna and then sent to Budapest, those relating to the interrogation conducted by the Palatine Thurz at Bicse (then Bittsere) at the very beginning of January 1611, and was thus able to take into account the reasons adduced as well as the order for the execution of the Countess&#x2019;s accomplices, dated 7th January.

Japan annexed Korea in 1910, and Hana speaks fluent Japanese, is educated in Japanese history and culture, and is prohibited from speaking, reading, or writing in her native Korean. She is a second-class citizen with second-class rights in her own country, but that does not diminish her Korean pride. Hana and her mother are <i>haenyeo</i>, women of the sea, and they work for themselves. They live in a tiny village on Jeju Island&#x2019;s southern coast and dive in a cove hidden from the main road that leads into town. Hana&#x2019;s father is a fisherman. He navigates the South Sea with the other village men, evading imperial fishing boats that loot Korea&#x2019;s coastal waters for produce to repatriate back to Japan. Hana and her mother only interact with Japanese soldiers when they go to market to sell their day&#x2019;s catch. It creates a sense of freedom not many on the other side of the island, or even on mainland Korea, a hundred miles to the north, enjoy. The occupation is a taboo topic, especially at market; only the brave dare to broach it, and even then only in whispers and behind cupped hands. The villagers are tired of the heavy taxes, the forced <i>donations</i> to the war effort, and the taking of men to fight on the front lines and children to work in factories in Japan.</p><p>On Hana&#x2019;s island, diving is women&#x2019;s work. Their bodies suit the cold depths of the ocean better than men&#x2019;s. They can hold their breath longer, swim deeper, and keep their body temperature warmer, so for centuries,&nbsp;Jeju women have enjoyed a rare independence. Hana followed her mother into the sea at an early age. Learning to swim began the moment she could lift her head on her own, though she was nearly eleven the first time her mother took her into the deeper waters and showed her how to cut an abalone from a rock on the seafloor. In her excitement, Hana lost her breath sooner than expected and had to race upward for air. Her lungs burned. When she finally broke the surface, she breathed in more water than oxygen. Sputtering with her chin barely above the waves, she was disoriented and began to panic. A sudden swell rolled over her, submerging her in an instant. She swallowed more water as her head dipped beneath the surface.</p><p>With one hand, her mother lifted Hana&#x2019;s face above the water. Hana gulped in air between racking coughs. Her nose and throat burned. Her mother&#x2019;s hand, secured at the nape of her neck, reassured her until she recovered.</p><p>&#x201c;Always look to the shore when you rise, or you can lose your way,&#x201d; her mother said, and turned Hana to face the land. There on the sand, her younger sister sat protecting the buckets containing the day&#x2019;s catch. &#x201c;Look for your sister after each dive. Never forget. If you see her, you are safe.&#x201d;</p><p>When Hana&#x2019;s breaths had returned to normal, her mother released her and commenced diving with a slow forward somersault down into the ocean&#x2019;s depths. Hana watched her sister a few moments longer, taking in the serene sight of her resting on the beach, waiting for her family to return from the sea. Fully recovered, Hana swam to the buoy and added her abalone to her mother&#x2019;s catch, which was stowed safely in a net. Then she performed her own somersault, down into the ocean&#x2019;s thrumming interior, in search of another sea creature to add to their harvest.</p><p>Her sister was too young to dive with them when they were that far from the shore. Sometimes, when Hana surfaced, she would look first to the shore to find her sister chasing after seagulls, waving sticks wildly in the air. She was like a butterfly dancing across Hana&#x2019;s sightline.</p><p>Hana was already seven years old when her sister was finally born. She had worried she would be an only child her whole life. She had wished for a younger sibling for so long&#x2014;all of her friends had two, three, or sometimes even four brothers and sisters to play with each day and to share the burden of household chores, while she had to suffer everything alone. But then her mother became pregnant, and Hana swelled with such hope that she beamed each time she caught a glimpse of her mother&#x2019;s growing stomach.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re much fatter today, aren&#x2019;t you, Mother?&#x201d; she asked the morning of her sister&#x2019;s birth.</p><p>&#x201c;Very, very fat and uncomfortable!&#x201d; her mother replied, and tickled Hana&#x2019;s taut stomach.</p><p>She tumbled onto her back and giggled with delight. Once she caught her breath, Hana sat beside her mother and placed a hand on the outermost curve of her bulging stomach.</p><p>&#x201c;My sister or brother must be nearly done, right, Mother?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nearly done? You speak as though I&#x2019;m boiling rice inside my belly, silly girl!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not rice, my new sister&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or brother,&#x201d; Hana added quickly, and felt a timid kick against her hand. &#x201c;When will she, or he, come out?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Such an impatient daughter sits before me.&#x201d; Her mother shook her head in resignation. &#x201c;Which would you prefer, a sister or a brother?&#x201d;</p><p>Hana knew the correct answer was a brother, so that her father would have a son to share his fishing knowledge with, but in her head she answered differently. <i>I hope you have a daughter, so that one day, she can swim in the sea with me.</i></p><p>Her mother went into labor that evening, and when they showed Hana her baby sister, she couldn&#x2019;t contain her happiness. She smiled the widest smile her face had ever known, yet tried with all her might to speak as though she was disappointed.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry that she is not a son, Mother, truly sorry,&#x201d; Hana said, shaking her head in mock sorrow.</p><p>Then Hana turned to her father and pulled his shirtsleeve. He leaned down, and she cupped her hands around his ear.</p><p>&#x201c;Father, I must confess something to you. I&#x2019;m very sorry for you, that she is not a son to learn your fishing skills, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She took a deep breath before finishing. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m so happy I have a sister to swim with.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that so?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but don&#x2019;t tell Mother.&#x201d;</p><p>At seven years old, Hana was not skilled in the art of whispering, and gentle laughter rippled through the group of her parents&#x2019; closest friends. Hana grew quiet. Her ears burned. She hid behind her father and peeked at her mother from underneath his arm to see if she had also heard. Her mother gazed at her eldest daughter and then looked down at the hungry infant suckling her breast and whispered to her newest daughter, just loud enough for Hana to hear.</p><p>&#x201c;You are the most loved little sister in the whole of Jeju Island. Do you know that? No one will ever love you more than your big sister.&#x201d;</p><p>When she looked up at Hana, she motioned for her to come to her&nbsp;side. The adults in the room grew quiet as Hana knelt beside her mother.</p><p>&#x201c;You are her protector now, Hana,&#x201d; her mother said in a serious tone.</p><p>Hana gazed at her tiny baby sister. She reached out to caress the black tuft of hair sprouting from her scalp.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s so soft,&#x201d; Hana said with wonder.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you hear what I said? You are a big sister now, and with that comes responsibilities, and the first one is that of protector. I won&#x2019;t always be around; diving in the sea and selling at the market keeps us fed, and it will be left up to you to watch over your little sister from now on when I can&#x2019;t. Can I rely on you?&#x201d; her mother asked, her voice stern.</p><p>Hana&#x2019;s hand shot back to her side. She bowed her head and dutifully answered.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Mother, I will keep her safe. I promise.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A promise is forever, Hana. Never forget.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will remember, Mother, always,&#x201d; Hana said, her eyes glued onto her little sister&#x2019;s peacefully dozing face. Milk dripped from the side of the baby&#x2019;s open mouth, and her mother wiped it with a swipe of her thumb.</p><p>As the years passed, and Hana began to dive with her mother in the deeper waters, she grew accustomed to seeing her sister in the distance, the girl who shared her blankets at night and whispered silly stories into the darkness, until she finally succumbed to sleep. The girl who laughed at everything and anything, a sound that made everyone nearby join in. She became Hana&#x2019;s anchor, to the shore and to life.</p><p>Hana knows that protecting her sister means keeping her away from Japanese soldiers. Her mother has drilled the lesson into her: <i>Never let them see you! And most of all, do not let yourself be caught alone with one!</i> Her mother&#x2019;s words of warning are filled with an ominous fear, and at sixteen Hana feels lucky this has never happened. But that changes on a hot summer day.</p><p>It is late in the afternoon, long after the other divers have gone to the market, when Hana first sees Corporal Morimoto. Her mother wanted to fill an extra net for a friend who was ill and couldn&#x2019;t dive that day. Her mother is always the first to offer help. Hana comes up for air and looks to the shore. Her sister is squatting on the sand, shading her eyes to look out toward Hana and their mother. At nine years of age, her sister is now old enough to stay on the shore alone but still too young to swim in the deeper waters with Hana and her mother. She is small for her age and not yet a strong swimmer.</p><p>Hana has just found a large conch and is ready to shout at her sister to express her joy, when she notices a man heading toward the beach. Treading water so that she can lift herself higher to see him more clearly, Hana realizes the man is a Japanese soldier. Her stomach knots into a sudden cramp. Why is he here? They never come this far from the villages. She scans the beach within the cove to see if there are more, but he&#x2019;s the only one. He is heading straight for her sister.</p><p>A ridge of rocks shields her sister from his view, but it won&#x2019;t do so for long. If he stays on his current path, he will stumble upon her, and then he will take her away&#x2014;ship her off to a factory in Japan like the other young girls who disappear from the villages. Her sister isn&#x2019;t strong enough to survive factory work or the brutal conditions they are subjected to. She is too young, and too loved, to be taken away.</p><p>Searching the horizon for her mother, Hana realizes she is down below, oblivious to the Japanese soldier heading toward the water&#x2019;s edge. She has no time to wait for her mother to resurface, and even if she did, her mother is too far away, hunting near the edge of the reef where it drops into a cavernous void with no seafloor in sight for miles. It is Hana&#x2019;s job to protect her little sister. She made a promise to her mother, and she intends to keep it.</p><p>Hana dives beneath the waves, swimming at full speed toward the beach. She can only hope to reach her sister before the soldier does. If she can distract him long enough, perhaps her sister can slip away and hide in the nearby cove, and then Hana can escape back into the ocean. Surely he wouldn&#x2019;t follow her into the water?</p><p>The current crushes against her as though desperate to push her back out to sea, toward safety. Panicking, she breaches the water&#x2019;s surface and takes in a deep breath, catching a glimpse of the soldier&#x2019;s progress. He is still headed for the rocky ledge.</p><p>She starts to swim above the waves, aware she is exposing herself but unable to bear staying too long beneath the water for fear of missing the soldier&#x2019;s advance. Hana is halfway to her sister when she sees him stop. He digs in his pocket for something. Plunging her head back into the water, she swims even faster. In her next breath, she sees him light a cigarette. With every subsequent breath, he moves just a little more. He blows out a puff of smoke, takes a drag, breathes it out, again and again with each lift of her head, until the last breath, when he looks toward the ocean and notices Hana&#x2019;s race toward him.</p><p>Only ten meters away from the shore, she hopes he can&#x2019;t see her little sister from where he stands. She is still hidden by the rocks, but not for long. Her small hands are on the stony sand, and she is beginning to push herself up to standing. Hana can&#x2019;t shout at her to stay down. She swims faster.</p><p>Hana pitches beneath the surface, pulling the water out of her way with each stroke, until her hands touch the sandy ground. Then she shoots to her feet and runs through the last few meters of shallow water. If he has called out to her as she runs toward the ledge, she can&#x2019;t hear him. Her heart thunders in her ears, blocking out all sound. It feels like she has traveled across half the earth in that sprint to the shore, but she can&#x2019;t stop yet. Her feet fly across the sand toward her sister, who is smiling at her in ignorance and preparing to greet Hana. Before her sister can speak, Hana lunges at her, seizing her shoulders and knocking her to the ground.</p><p>She covers her sister&#x2019;s mouth with her hand to keep her from crying out. When she sees Hana&#x2019;s face hovering above her, she knows better than to cry. Hana gives her a look only a little sister would understand. She pushes her sister into the sand, wishing she could bury her to hide her from the soldier&#x2019;s sight, but she has no time.</p><p>&#x201c;Where did you go?&#x201d; the soldier calls down to Hana. He is standing on a low rock ledge overlooking the beach. If he stands on the edge he could look down and see them both lying beneath him. &#x201c;Has the mermaid transformed into a girl?&#x201d;</p><p>His boots crunch on the stones above them. Her sister&#x2019;s trembling body feels fragile in Hana&#x2019;s hands. Her fear is contagious, and Hana, too, begins to tremble. She realizes there is nowhere for her sister to run. From his vantage point, he can see in every direction. They will both have to escape into the ocean, but her sister can&#x2019;t swim for very long. Hana can remain in the deep water for hours, but her little sister will drown if the soldier decides to wait them out. She has no plan. No escape. The realization sits heavy in her gut.</p><p>Slowly, she releases her sister&#x2019;s mouth and takes one last look into her frightened face before standing. His eyes are sharp, and she feels their piercing touch as they creep over her body.</p><p>&#x201c;Not a girl, but a grown woman,&#x201d; he says, and lets out a low, grumbling laugh.</p></p><h2>Sicily History and Masterpieces</h2><p>Hard to Find book</p><p></p><h2>Lee Bailey&#39;s Country Desserts</h2><p>Enticing recipes, collected from family and friends, together with many gorgeous photographs. <b>155 full-color and 46 black-and-white illustrations.</b></p><p>ipes, collected from family and friends, together with many gorgeous photographs. <b>155 full-color and 46 black-and-white illustrations.</b></p><h2>A German General on the Eastern Front: The Letters and Diaries of Gotthard Heinrici 1941-1942</h2><p>The Eastern Front, 1941. Operation Barbarossa. Hitler&#x2019;s armies advance into the Soviet Union to conquer Lebensraum in the East. Among the corps commanders is General Gotthard Heinrici, a career soldier, a highly decorated First World War veteran, who observed and recorded in his diary and letters the unprecedented harshness of the German conduct of the campaign. With remarkable candor he described his experiences at the front and the everyday lives of the troops under his command - and the appalling conditions in which the war was fought. In his writings he revealed his growing doubts about Hitler's strategy and his mounting concern as the Wehrmacht was implicated in war crimes and the first actions of the Holocaust. This selection from Heinrici&#x2019;s diaries and letters, edited and with a perceptive introduction by Johannes H�rter, gives a fascinating inside view of the fighting on the Eastern Front from a commander&#x2019;s perspective. It is also provides an unusual insight into the feelings, attitudes and acute anxieties of one of the Wehrmacht&#x2019;s most able generals in the midst of a brutal campaign.</p><p>Dr Johannes Hurter is a leading German historian of the Second World War based at the Institute of Contemporary History in Munich.

In the much anticipated fourth book in Stephenie Meyer&#39;s love story, questions will be answered and the fate of Bella and Edward will be revealed.</p><p>Great love stories thrive on sacrifice. Throughout The Twilight Saga (<em>Twilight</em>, <em>New Moon</em>, and <em>Eclipse</em>), Stephenie Meyer has emulated great love stories--<em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, <em>Wuthering Heights</em>--with the fated, yet perpetually doomed love of Bella (the human girl) and Edward (the vampire who feeds on animals instead of humans). In <em>Breaking Dawn</em>, the fourth and final installment in the series, Bella&#x2019;s story plays out in some unexpected ways. The ongoing conflicts that made this series so compelling--a human girl in love with a vampire, a werewolf in love with a human girl, the generations-long feud between werewolves and vampires--resolve pretty quickly, apparently so that Meyer could focus on Bella&#x2019;s latest opportunity for self-sacrifice: giving her life for someone she loves even more than Edward. How close she comes to actually making that sacrifice is questionable, which is a big shift from the earlier books. Even though you knew Bella would make it through somehow, the threats to her life, and to her relationship with Edward, had previously always felt real. It&#x2019;s as if Meyer was afraid of hurting her characters too much, which is unfortunate, because the pain Bella suffered at losing Edward in <em>New Moon</em>, and the pain Jacob suffered at losing Bella again and again, are the fire and the heart that drive the whole series. Diehard fans will stick with Bella, Edward, and Jacob for as many twists and turns as possible, but after most of the characters get what they want with little sacrifice, some readers may have a harder time caring what happens next.

The authors&#39; pursuit of the notion that Vlad the Impaler (1431-76) was the original Dracula--through treks both antiquarian (in old libraries and museums) and geographic (in areas of Romania that were once Transylvania and Walachia)--has the thrill of an adventure story. In Search of Dracula is also an entertaining introduction to vampire lore and to people&#39;s obsession with Dracula.

Random House, 2005.</p><p>From one of the leading literary figures of our time, a gripping international tale of love and revenge, and the ancient and modern conflicts from which they spring. <br>Los Angeles, 1991. Ambassador Maximilian Ophuls, one of the makers of the modern world, is murdered in broad daylight on his illegitimate daughter India's doorstep, slaughtered by a knife wielded by his Kashmiri Muslim driver, a mysterious figure who calls himself Shalimar the clown. The dead man is a charismatic World War Two Resistance hero, a man of formidable intellectual ability, a former US ambassador to India and subsequently America's counter-terrorism chief. The murder looks at first like a political assassination, but turns out to be passionately personal. <br>This is the story of Max Ophuls, his killer and his daughter -- and of a fourth character, the woman who links them, whose story finally explains them all. It is an epic narrative that moves from California to Kashmir, from Nazi-occupied Europe to the world of modern terrorism. Along the way there is kindness, and magic capable of producing miracles; there is also war -- ugly, unavoidable and seemingly interminable. And there is always love, gained and lost, uncommonly beautiful and mortally dangerous. <br>Everything is unsettled. Everything is connected. Lives are uprooted, names keep changing -- nothing is permanent. The story of anywhere is also the story of everywhere else. Spanning the globe and darting through history, Rushdie's narrative captures the heart of the reader and the spirit of a troubled age. <p>"The second portent came on the morning of the murder, when Shalimar the driver approached Max Ophuls at breakfast, handed him his schedulecard for the day, and gave in his notice. The ambassador's drivers tended to be short-term appointees, inclined to move on to new adventures in pornography or hairdressing, and Max was inured to the cycle of acquisition and loss. This time, however, he was shaken, though he did not care to show it. He concentrated on his day's appointments, trying not to let the card shake. He knew Shalimar's real name. He knew the village he came from and the story of his life. He knew the intimate connection between his own scandalous past and this grave unscandalous man who never laughed in spite of the creased eyes that hinted at a happier past, this man with a gymnast's body and a tragedian's face who had slowly become more of a valet than a mere driver, a silent yet utterly solicitous body servant who understood what Max needed before he knew it himself, the lighted cigar that materialized just as he was reaching for the humidor, the right cuff-links that were laid out on his bed each morning with the perfect shirt, the ideal temperature for his bathwater, the right times to be absent as well as the correct moments to appear.

He traveled 100,000 miles back and forth, from Antarctica to the Caribbean, from the Mediterranean to the Far East, to capture a last glint of imperial glory.</p> <p>His adventures in these distant and forgotten ends of the earth make compelling, often funny reading and tell a story most of us had thought was over: a tale of the last outposts in Britain's imperial career and those who keep the flag flying.</p> <p>With a new introduction, this updated edition tells us what has happened to these extraordinary places while the author's been away.</p></p><p><p>Simon Winchester is the acclaimed author of many books, including <em>The Professor and the Madman</em>, <em>The Men Who United the States, The Map That Changed the World, The Man Who Loved China, A Crack in the Edge of the World,</em> and <em>Krakatoa</em>, all of which were <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers and appeared on numerous best and notable lists. In 2006, Winchester was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Her Majesty the Queen. He resides in western Massachusetts.</p>Simon Winchester travels to the far reaches of the British Empire. Winchester reads his own sometimes oddball tales. He tells of a cricket match on St. Helena in which a fielder falls off the edge and thus is "retired, dead." On Ascension Island, an island so small it was considered a ship--the H.M.S. ASCENSION--any baby born was considered born at sea. Winchester's nicely modulated voice is perfect for reading this history/travelogue. He is engaging while narrating the history and perpetually amused at the quirks of keeping the Empire alive no matter the discomfort. The production concludes with an interview in which Winchester discusses his delight at discovering that readers share his fascination with geology.

It is a fantastic read, in many ways the best and gutsiest of the series. We join the Texas Rangers in their waning Indian-fighting years. The Comanches, after one last desperate raid led by the fearsome-but-aging Buffalo Hump, are almost defeated, though Buffalo Hump's son, Blue Duck, still terrorizes the relentless flow of settlers and lawmen. As Augustus and Woodrow follow one-eyed, tobacco-spitting Captain Inish Scull deep into a murderous madman's den in Mexico, their thoughts turn toward the end of their careers and the women they love in remarkably different ways back in Austin. What's amazing about McMurtry's West is that he sees beyond the romance. Neither his Indians, his cowboys, his gunslingers, nor his women act the way they did in either Zane Grey novels or John Wayne movies. Incredible beauty and lightning-quick violence are the bookends of his West, but it is the in-between moments of suffering and boredom where McMurtry shines. The suffering is poignant and heart-rending; the boredom tempered with doses of Augustus McCrae's sharp humor. Don't be surprised if you find yourself crying and laughing on the same page.<p>A brilliant and haunting novel richly capable of standing on its own. <i>Comanche Moon</i> completes Larry McMurtry's epic cycle of novels of the American West that began with the Pulitzer-Prize-winning masterpiece, Lonesome Dove. </p><p>We join Texas Rangers August McCrae and Woodrow F.

With echoes of <em>The Liars&#x2019; Club </em>and <em>Don&#x2019;t Let&#x2019;s Go to the Dogs Tonight</em>, Coleman&#x2019;s searing chronicle tells the true story of her upbringing on communes and sustainable farms along the rugged Maine coastline in the 1970&#x2019;s, embedded within a moving, personal quest for truth that her experiences produced. </p></p><p><p>Set on a rugged coastal homestead during the 1970s, <em>This Life Is in Your Hands</em> introduces a superb young writer driven by the need to uncover the truth of a childhood tragedy and connect anew with the beauty and vitality of the back-to-the-land ideal that shaped her early years.</p><p>In the fall of 1968, Melissa Coleman's parents, Eliot and Sue&#x2014;a handsome, idealistic young couple from well-to-do families&#x2014;pack a few essentials into their VW truck and abandon the complications of modern reality to carve a farm from the woods. They move to a remote peninsula on the coast of Maine and become disciples of Helen and Scott Nearing, authors of the homesteading bible <em>Living the Good Life</em>. On sixty acres of sandy, intractable land, Eliot and Sue begin to forge a new existence, subsisting on the crops they grow and building a home with their own hands.</p><p>While they establish a happy family and achieve their visionary goals, the pursuit of a purer, simpler life comes at a price.

In the wake of the accident, ideals give way to human frailty, divorce, and a mother's breakdown&#x2014;and ultimately young Melissa is abandoned to the care of neighbors. What really happened, and who, if anyone, is to blame?</p><p><em>This Life Is in Your Hands</em> is the search to understand a complicated past; a true story, both tragic and redemptive, it tells of the quest to make a good life, the role of fate, and the power of forgiveness.</p><p>As a freelance writer, Melissa Coleman has covered lifestyle, health, and travel.

She lives in London with her husband and two sons.I<br><br>WILHELM<br><br><i>An Experiment in Perfection</i><br><br>1859<br><br>It was a horrible labour. The baby was in the breech position and no one realized until too late. The eighteen-year-old mother had been too embarrassed to allow any of the court physicians to examine or even talk to her about her pregnancy&#x2014;a prudishness learned from her own mother. The experience of childbirth would cure her of it. To make matters worse, an urgent summons to Berlin&#x2019;s most eminent obstetrician got lost. After ten or eleven hours of excruciating pain&#x2014; the mother cried for chloroform, she was given a handkerchief to bite on (her screams, her husband later wrote, were &#x201c;horrible&#x201d;)&#x2014;the attending doctors, one German, one English, had pretty much given up on her and the baby. (There were bad precedents for medics who carried out risky interventions on royal patients: when Princess Charlotte, the heir to the British throne, died in childbirth in 1817, the attending physician felt obliged to shoot himself.) The child survived only because the famous obstetrician eventually received the message and arrived at the last minute. With liberal doses of chloroform and some difficulty, the doctor managed to manipulate the baby out. He emerged pale, limp, one arm around his neck, badly bruised and not breathing. The attending nurse had to rub and slap him repeatedly to make him cry. The sound, when it came, the boy&#x2019;s father wrote, &#x201c;cut through me like an electric shock.&#x201d; Everybody wept with relief. It was 27 January 1859.<br><br>At the moment of his birth, two, or arguably three, factors immediately had a defining effect on the life and character of Friedrich Victor Wilhelm Albert Hohenzollern&#x2014;soon known as Willy to distinguish him, his father said, from the &#x201c;legion of Fritzes&#x201d; in the family. Firstly, the baby&#x2019;s left arm was damaged in the delivery &#x2014;a fact which, in the relief and excitement following his birth, wasn&#x2019;t noticed for three days. It seems likely that in the obstetrician&#x2019;s urgency to get the baby out before he suffocated, he wrenched and irretrievably crushed the network of nerves in Willy&#x2019;s arm, rendering it useless and unable to grow. Secondly, and unprovably, it&#x2019;s possible that those first few minutes without oxygen may have caused brain damage. Willy grew up to be hyperactive and emotionally unstable; brain damage sustained at birth was a possible cause.<br><br>Thirdly, an almost impossible burden of conflicting demands and expectations came to rest upon Willy at the moment of his birth. Through his father, Friedrich, one of the ubiquitous Fritzes, he was heir to the throne of Prussia; his mother, Vicky, was the first-born child of Queen Victoria of Great Britain, and he was the British queen&#x2019;s first grandchild. As heir to Prussia, the biggest and most influential power in the loose confederation of thirty-eight duchies, kingdoms and four free cities that called itself Germany, he carried his family&#x2019;s and country&#x2019;s dreams of the future. Those dreams saw Prussia as the dominant power in a unified Germany, taking its place as one of the Great Powers. For Queen Victoria, monarch of the richest and arguably most influential country in the world, Willy was both a doted-on grandchild&#x2014;&#x201c;a fine fat child with a beautiful soft white skin,&#x201d; as she put it when she finally saw him twenty months later&#x2014; and the symbol and vehicle of a new political and dynastic bond between England and Prussia, a state whose future might take it in several different directions, directions in which Britain&#x2019;s monarch and her husband took an intense interest. Three days after his birth the queen wrote delightedly to her friend and fellow grandmother Augusta of Prussia, &#x201c;Our mutual grandson binds us and our two countries even closer together!&#x201d;<br><br>Queen Victoria felt a deep affinity with Germany. Her mother was German and so was her husband, Albert, the younger brother of the ruling duke of the small but influential central German duchy of Coburg. She carried on intense correspondences with several German royals, including Fritz&#x2019;s mother, Augusta, and she would marry six of her nine children to Germans. Although the queen&#x2019;s Germanophilia was sometimes criticized in England, the British were at least less hostile to the Germans than they were to France and Russia, and occasionally even approving. At the battle of Waterloo, Britain and Prussia had fought side by side to defeat Napoleon, and well into the 1850s as a salute to the old alliance there were still German regiments stationed on the South Coast. Thomas Hardy described the German hussars stationed in Dorset in the 1850s as being so deeply embedded in the local culture that their language had over the years woven itself into the local dialect: &#x201c;Thou bist&#x201d; and &#x201c;Er war&#x201d; becoming familiar locutions. Germany&#x2014;or at least the northern part&#x2014; was the other Protestant power in Europe. German culture was much admired. In turn, German liberals looked to Britain as the model for a future German constitutional monarchy, its traders admired British practice, and at the other end of the political spectrum, it was to England that some of the more reactionary members of the German ruling elite&#x2014;including Willy&#x2019;s German grandfather&#x2014;had fled during the revolutions of 1848. There he and his wife Augusta had become friends&#x2014; sort of&#x2014;of the queen and her husband Albert.<br><br>Albert, the Prince Consort, an intelligent, energetic and thoughtful man denied a formal public role in England, was even more preoccupied with Germany than his wife, particularly with its future and that of its ruling class. He had seen the German royals rocked by the revolutions of 1848, their very existence called into question by the rise of republicanism and democratic movements. He&#x2019;d come to believe that Germany&#x2019;s future lay in unification under a modern liberal constitutional monarchy, like that of England. Prussia, as the largest, strongest state in Germany, was the obvious candidate.<br><br>Though it was not necessarily the perfect one. Prussia was a peculiar hybrid, rather like Germany itself: it was half dynamic and forward- looking, half autocratic backwater. On the one hand, it was a rich state with an impressive civil service, a fine education system, and a fast-growing industrial heartland in the Western Rhineland. It had been one of the first states in Europe to emancipate Jews, and had a tradition of active citizenship, demonstrated most visibly in 1813, when it had not been the pusillanimous king but a determined citizenry who had pulled together an army to fight Napoleon. After 1848 a representative assembly, the Landtag, had been forced on the king and liberal politicians and thinkers seemed to be in the ascendant. On the other hand, however, Prussia was stuck in the dark ages: it was a semi- autocracy whose ruling institutions were dominated by a deeply conservative small landowning class from its traditional heartland on the East Elbian plain, the Junkers. They had a reputation for being tough, austere, incorruptible, fearsomely reactionary, piously Protestant, anti-Semitic, feudal in their attitudes to their workers, their land and their women, and resistant to almost any change&#x2014; whether democratization, urbanization or industrialization&#x2014;which might threaten their considerable privileges. These included almost total exemption from taxation. They dominated the Prussian court, the most conservative in Germany. They regarded Prussia&#x2019;s next-door neighbour, Russia&#x2014;England&#x2019;s great world rival&#x2014;as their natural ally, sharing with Russia a long frontier, a belief in autocratic government and a pervasive military culture.<br><br>Prussia&#x2019;s highly professional army was the reason for its domination of Germany, and in many respects gave Prussia what political coherence and identity it had. It had long been dominated by the Junkers, and was the heart of Prussian conservatism. Almost all European aristocracies identified themselves with the army, but since the seventeenth century the Prussian aristocracy, more than any other, had been encouraged by its rulers to equate its noble status and privileges entirely with senior military rank. It was not unusual for boys of the Prussian ruling classes to wear military uniform from the age of six. History showed that war paid: Prussia had benefited territorially from every central European military conflict since the Thirty Years War in the seventeenth century. In the eighteenth century Frederick the Great had doubled Prussia&#x2019;s size in a series of vicious central European wars. Prussia&#x2019;s intervention in the Napoleonic Wars had doubled its size again, making it the dominant power in Germany. But at the same time, Prussia&#x2019;s military culture had arisen not simply from a desire to expand and conquer, but quite as much from the fact that the Prussian ruling class was haunted&#x2014;obsessed even&#x2014;by its country&#x2019;s vulnerability in the middle of Europe, undefended by natural barriers, always a potential victim for some larger power&#x2019;s territorial ambitions. Territorial expansion had constantly alternated with disaster and near annihilation. During the Thirty Years War, Prussia had lost half its population to disease, famine and fighting; the scar remained in folk memory. During the Napoleonic Wars, it had been humiliated, overrun and threatened with dismemberment while the French and Russians squared up to each other. Since then, Prussia had been hostile to France and carefully deferential to the Russian colossus next door. The ruling dynasties of Hohenzollern and Romanov had intermarried and even developed genuine friendships. Willy&#x2019;s Prussian great-aunt Charlotte had married Tsar Nicholas I, and Willy&#x2019;s grandfather, who would become King of Prussia and then Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany, enjoyed a long and close friendship with his son, Tsar Alexander II.<br><br>The contradictions in Prussia mirrored the extraordinary heterogeneity of Germany and its states as a whole. Within its loose boundaries there existed a plethora of conflicting Germanies: the Germany that led the world in scientific and technological innovation, the Germany that was the most cultured, literate, academically innovative state in Europe&#x2014;the Germany of Goethe, Leibnitz, the von Humboldt brothers, Bach and Beethoven&#x2014;stood alongside the Germany of resolutely philistine Junkers. In East Elbia, the heartland of the Junker estates, disenfranchised peasants lived in almost feudal conditions, and yet at the same time Germany was the most industrialized place in Europe with some of the best labour conditions. Germany had some of the most hierarchical, undemocratic states in Europe, ruled by an embarrassment of self-important little princelings, and was also home to the largest and best organized Socialist Party in Europe. Southern, predominantly Catholic, Germany coexisted with northern, Protestant Germany. It seems entirely appropriate that Berlin, Prussia&#x2019;s capital, with its vast avenues, seemed like a parade ground, while also being a centre for political radicalism, for scholarship, for a wealthy Jewish community.<br><br>Prince Albert believed there was a battle going on for the soul and political future of Germany. &#x201c;The German stands in the centre between England and Russia,&#x201d; he wrote to his future son-in-law Fritz in 1856. &#x201c;His high culture and his philosophic love of truth drive him towards the English conception, his military discipline, his admiration of the asiatic greatness . . . which is achieved by the merging of the individual into the whole, drives him in the other direction.&#x201d; Albert also felt that in the post-1848 world, monarchy was under threat. He wanted to prove that good relations between monarchies created peace between countries. And he had come to the conclusion that princes must justify their status by their moral and intellectual superiority to everyone else.<br><br>One of Albert&#x2019;s projects had been to design a rigorous academic regime for his eight children to turn them into accomplished princes. His eldest daughter, Vicky&#x2014;his favourite&#x2014;responded brilliantly to it. She was clever, intellectually curious and passionate&#x2014;qualities not always associated with royalty. Her younger brother Bertie&#x2014;the future Edward VII&#x2014;had suffered miserably under the same regime. Albert thought that, under the right circumstances, a royal marriage between Britain and Prussia might nudge Germany in the right direction, towards unification, towards a constitutional monarchy and a safe future for the German royal families. It might even bring about an alliance with Britain, an alliance which could become the cornerstone of peace in Europe. Albert resolved to send his clever daughter on a mission to fix Germany, by marrying Vicky to Friedrich Wilhelm Hohenzollern, nephew of the childless and increasingly doddery King of Prussia, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, and second in line to the throne after his sixty-two-year-old father, who had already taken over many of his brother&#x2019;s duties.<br><br>Fritz, as he was called, was ten years older than Vicky, dashingly handsome, charismatic and an effective officer&#x2014;so much the Wagnerian hero that in Germany he was actually known as Siegfried. The marriage, which took place in January 1858, looked good on paper&#x2014;the heir of the rising Protestant German state marrying the daughter of the richest, stablest power in Europe. Unlike most arranged royal marriages, it worked even better in reality. Personally gentle, earnest and prone to depression&#x2014;somewhat at odds with the emphatically blunt, masculine ideal of the Prussian officer&#x2014;twenty- seven-year-old Fritz adored his clever seventeen-year-old wife, and she adored him. He also showed, Victoria and Albert noted approvingly, a liking for England and admirable liberal tendencies very much at odds with those of his father and the Prussian court.<br><br>At the time, the plan of sending a completely inexperienced seventeen- year-old girl to unify Germany may not have seemed quite so extraordinary as it does now. The external circumstances looked promising. In 1858 the political balance in Prussia seemed to be held by the liberals: they had just won a landslide victory in the Landtag elections. Prussia&#x2019;s king was elderly and had recently suffered a series of incapacitating strokes, and his heir, Fritz&#x2019;s father, was sixty-two years old. Fritz and Vicky shouldn&#x2019;t have to wait too long before they would be in control.<br><br>That was the plan. It didn&#x2019;t turn out that way. Firstly, Albert had been away from Germany a long time and didn&#x2019;t understand how suspicious the Prussian ruling class was of Vicky&#x2019;s Englishness, and how touchy about the prospect that larger powers might interfere in its country. &#x201c;The &#x2018;English&#x2019; in it does not please me,&#x201d; the future chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, told a friend, &#x201c;the &#x2018;marriage&#x2019; may be quite good . . . If the Princess can leave the Englishwoman at home.&#x201d; Secondly, Vicky, though extremely bright, had no talent for politics, was hopelessly tactless and held fast to her Englishness. Thirdly, Fritz&#x2019;s father turned out to be astonishingly long-lived, and appointed Otto von Bismarck, the greatest conservative European statesman of the late nineteenth century, his chief minister.<br><br>It went wrong quite quickly. The Prussian court was not welcoming and was critical of Vicky&#x2019;s forthright views and intellectual confidence. Prussian wives were supposed to be silent and submissive; there was none of the leeway allowed in Britain for an intelligent, educated woman to shine. It was said disapprovingly that Vicky dominated Fritz. She met intellectuals and artists, whether or not they were commoners, and this contravened the social strictures of court etiquette: princesses did not host salons or mix with non-royals. Bewildered and isolated, Vicky had no idea what to do. She responded with a social tone-deafness and complete lack of strategic tact which would become characteristic. She complained&#x2014;imperiously and incessantly&#x2014;about the philistine, ri...</p><h2>Bugatti Type 35 Owners&#39; Workshop Manual: 1924 onwards (all models) - An insight into the design, engineering, maintenance and operation of Bugatti&#39;s iconic pre-war grand prix car (Haynes Manuals)</h2><p>The Type 35 Bugatti brought new standards of workmanship and finish to racing and was the first Grand Prix car to be catalogued and offered for sale.&nbsp; This <i>Bugatti Type 35 Owners' Workshop Manual</i> contains the Bugatti Story and is an addition to our growing range of classic racing car manuals.&nbsp; Being a sister title to our <i>Bentley 4 1/2 Litre Owner's Workshop Manual</i>, and having input from respected restorers and owners, the book contains sections covering variants, competition history, anatomy, view from drivers, owners and engineers, restoration and historic racing results.</p><p><p><b>Chas Parker</b> has written a number of books about motorsport, including Haynes Manuals for the D-type Jaguar and Bugatti Type 35 and others.

Introduction by Wallace Stegner. Penguin Nature Library.</p><p><b>John Wesley Powell </b>(1834-1902) was a professor of geology and director of the U.S. Geological Survey.<br><br><b>Wallace Stegner</b> was born in 1909 in Lake Mills, Iowa. The son of Scandinavian immigrants, he traveled with his parents and brother all over the West-to North Dakota, Washington, Saskatchewan, Montana, and Wyoming-before settling in Salt Lake City in 1921. Many of the landscapes he encountered in his peripatetic youth figure largely in his work, as do characters based on his stern father and athletic, outgoing brother. Stegner received most of his education in Utah, graduating from the University in 1930. He furthered his education at the University of Iowa, where he received a master's and a doctoral degree. He married Mary Stuart Page in 1934, and for the next decade the couple followed Wallace's teaching career-to the University of Wisconsin, Harvard, and eventually to Stanford University, where he founded the creative writing program, and where he was to remain until his retirement in 1971. A number of his creative writing students have become some of today's most well respected writers, including Wendell Berry, Thomas McGuane, Raymond Carver, Edward Abbey, Robert Stone, and Larry McMurty.<br><br>Throughout his career and after, Stegner's literary output was tremendous. His first novel, Remembering Laughter, was published in 1937. By the time of his death in 1993 he had published some two dozen works of fiction, history, biography, and essays. Among his many literary prizes are the Pulitzer Prize for <b>Angle of Repose</b> (1971) and the National Book Award for <b>The Spectator Bird </b>(1976). His collection of essays, <b>Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs</b> (1992), was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle award.<br><br>Although his fiction deals with many universal themes, Stegner is primarily recognized as a writer of the American West. Much of his literature deals with debunking myths of the West as a romantic country of heroes on horseback, and his passion for the terrain and its inhabitants have earned him the title 'The Dean of Western Letters'. He was one of the few true Men of Letters in this generation. An historian, essayist, short story writer and novelist, as well as a leading environmental writer. Although always connected in people's minds with the West, he had a long association with New England. Many short stories and one of his most successful novels, Crossing to Safety, are set in Vermont, where he had a summer home for many years. Another novel, <b>The Spectator Bird</b>, takes place in Denmark.<br><br>An early environmentalist, he actively championed the region's preservation and was instrumental-with his now-famous 'Wilderness Letter'-in the passage of the 1964 Wilderness Act. Honest and straightforward, educated yet unpretentious, cantankerous yet compassionate, <b>Wallace Stegner</b> was an enormous presence in the American literary landscape, a man who wrote and lived with ferocity, energy, and integrity.</p><h2>Soups of Italy: Cooking over 130 Soups the Italian Way</h2><p>From preparing the lightest broth soups to hearty main coursesoups of vegetables, legumes, or fish, Norma Wasserman-Millertakes you into the kitchens of some of Italys best cooks to showyou how to transform simple basic ingredients into a wealth ofdelicious Italian soups.<p>Enjoy the wide range of soups prepared throughout Italy, fromthe great classics to superb original recipes created by some of Italys finest chefs. Sample a fragrant pasta and bean soup made with fennel; an aromatic pumpkin and herb minestrone; a savory fish soup made with porcini mushrooms; an elegant farro and radicchio soup; or one of the peasant soups that turn stale bread into a flavorful soup.</p><p>Each chapter gives clear directions and techniques for cooking the rich variety of Italian soups that include minestrone, pasta and bean, vegetable, fish, meat, bread, and grain soups. The uncommon authenticity and richness of this soup collection is wholesome, satisfying, and thoroughly delicious.</p></p><p>A passion for Italian home cooking (or <i>cucina di casa</i>, as she might tell us) has led Norma Wasserman-Miller from <i>Risotto</i>, which she cowrote, to <i>zuppa</i>. <i>Soups of Italy</i> is Wasserman-Miller's paean to the comforting first course that is often served twice a day in Italian homes. Rather than focusing on one region, she surveys all of Italy, showing the great difference, for example, between minestrone recipes from Milan, Naples, and Sicily. The book starts with a brief culinary history of soups in Italy (in the Middle Ages, the nobility were warned against eating this peasant cuisine!), followed by a lengthy introduction to soup techniques and more than 130 recipes, which are handily categorized by main ingredient. <p> Some readers may find Wasserman-Miller's heavy use of the Italian names for techniques and ingredients a bit off-putting. (For example, it's difficult to discern that the <i>sapori</i> and the <i>passatelli</i> are one and the same thing in her <i>Minestra di Passatelli</i> without knowing a bit of Italian.) Nevertheless, the recipes are authentic and the author has taken pains to help her audience recreate the Italian flavors at home. <i>Soups of Italy</i> is a delightful guidebook for cooks anxious to try their hand at simple Italian cooking found not in restaurants, but in everyday kitchens throughout the country.</p>Norma Wasserman-Miller is the co-author of the bestselling <em>Risotto</em> and is founder and co-owner of Formaggio Kitchen, a celebrated food store in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

She has taught in adult education and in schools and universities, and is the author of numerous books for children on historical topics.The author of A Medieval Castle, also in the ``Inside Story'' series, presents the ingenious, devoted, and indefatigable builders who perfected the medieval cathedral as a stone prayer to God and a place of community pride. Though again treading on the heels of David Macaulay, Macdonald and James hold their own, pointing out the religious significance of a bishop's seat, describing pilgrims' routes to other cathedrals, depicting the daily life of both workers and the religious community, and showing the variety of arts and crafts necessary to construction. In James's precisely detailed color illustrations, tiny figures climb dizzying heights of scaffolding to perform their tasks; the lofty elevation and difficulties of working with massive stone blocks on flimsy scaffolds should ignite interest in young folks. A few annoying picture captions don't parallel the text (e.g., ``St. James'' becomes ``Santiago''); still, a wealth of information is provided here in attractive style. ``Cathedral Facts and Building Styles'' are appended; glossary; index.

First published in 1947, revised for Gallimard in 1953, Querelle of Brest is widely considered to be Jean Genet&#39;s most accomplished novel, its renown further aided by Rainer Werner Fassbinder&#39;s film adaptation of 1982. Querelle, a young sailor at large in the port of Brest, is an object of illicit desire to his diary-keeping superior officer Lieutenant Seblon. He is coveted, too, by corrupt policeman Mario. He gives himself freely both to brothel-keeper Madame Lysiane and to her husband. But Querelle is a thief and a murderer - not a man to be trusted or trifled with. &#34;Genet takes seriously the threat latent in sexuality, and drags us with him to a confrontation with the basest of angels.&#34; (Michael Levenson, Harper&#39;s).</p><p>Jean Genet was born in Paris in 1910. An illegitimate child who never knew his parents, he was abandoned to the Public Assistance Authorities. He was ten when he was sent to a reformatory for stealing; thereafter he spent time in the prisons of nearly every country he visited in thirty years of prowling through the European underworld. With ten convictions for theft in France to his credit he was, the eleventh time, condemned to life imprisonment. Eventually he was granted a pardon by President Auriol as a result of appeals from France&#39;s leading artists and writers led by Jean Cocteau.$$$His first novel, Our Lady of the Flowers, was written while he was in prison, followed by Miracle of the Rose, the autobiographical The Thief&#39;s Journal, Querelle of Brest and Funeral Rites. He wrote six plays: The Balcony, The Blacks, The Screens, The Maids, Deathwatch and Splendid&#39;s (the manuscript of which was rediscovered only in 1993). Jean Genet died in 1986.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Design for Obama.

Innis&#39;s The Bias of Communication has played a major part in reshaping our understanding of history, communication, and media theory.

Innis considers political and economic forces in the context of social change and the role of communication in the creation of both ancient and modern empires. In an essay for this new edition, Innis biographer Alexander John Watson examines the reasons why Innis, at the height of his success as an economic historian, embarked on new research areas of communications and empire, as well as the ways in which Marshall McLuhan&#39;s interpretations of Innis changed and de-politicized Innis&#39;s work.

She was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and extraordinary plots and characterizations.<p><b>One</b></p> <p>It was past two o'clock when the job-chaise turned into Hill Street; and, as the watchman wending his way round Berkeley Square monotonously announced, a fine night. A full moon rode in the cloudless sky, dimming the street-lamps: even, as the solitary traveller had noticed, in Pall Mall, where gas-lighting had replaced the oil-burners. Linkmen, carriages, and light streaming from an open door on the east side of Berkeley Square indicated that not all the members of the ton had left London; but at the end of June the Season was drawing to a close; and it did not surprise the traveller to find Hill Street deserted. It would not have surprised him if the knocker had been removed from the door of a certain house on the north side of the street, but when the chaise drew up a swift scrutiny reassured him: the Earl of Denville's town residence had not yet been abandoned for the summer months. The traveller, a young man, wearing a tasselled and corded Polish greatcoat, and a shallow-crowned beaver, sprang down from the chaise, dragged a bulging portmanteau from the floor of this vehicle, set it down on the flagway, and pulled out his purse. The postboys paid, he picked up the portmanteau, trod up the steps to the front-door, and gave the iron bell-pull a tug.</p> <p>By the time the last echo of the clapper died away the chaise had disappeared, but no one had responded to the bell's summons. The traveller gave it a second, and more vigorous, tug. He heard it clanging somewhere in the nether regions, but was forced to conclude, after waiting for several minutes, that it had failed to rouse any of my lord's servants.</p> <p>He considered the matter. It was possible, though unlikely, that the household had removed from London without taking the knocker from the door, or shuttering the windows. To verify that the windows had not been shuttered he retreated to the flagway, and scanned the house, perceiving that not only were all the windows unshuttered but that one of them, on the entrance-floor, had been left open a few inches at the top. This gave, as he knew, on to the dining-room; and to reach it presented a lithe and determined young man with no insuperable difficulty. Divesting himself of his greatcoat, and trusting that no watchman would come down the street in time to observe his clandestine entry, he proceeded to demonstrate to the uninterested moon that Colonel Dan Mackinnon, of the Coldstream Guards, was not without a rival in the art of perilous climbing.</p> <p>No such thought entered the Hon. Christopher Fancot's head: he was not acquainted with Colonel Mackinnon; and he did not think the feat of reaching the desired window-sill either dangerous or difficult. Once there it was easy to thrust up the lower sash, and to swing himself into the room. A couple of minutes later he emerged into the hall, where, upon a marble-topped side-table, he found a lamp burning low, with an unlit candle in a silver holder standing beside it. Observing these objects with an intelligent eye, Mr Fancot concluded that their noble owner had told his servants not to wait up for him. The subsequent discovery that the front-door was unbolted confirmed him in this belief. As he opened the door, to retrieve his belongings from the porch, he reflected, with an inward chuckle, that when his lordship did come home at last he would find his bed occupied by a most unlooked-for visitor, and would in all probability think that he was a great deal boskier than he had supposed.</p> <p>On this thought, which appeared, from the mischievous smile which played about the corners of his mouth, to afford Mr Fancot amusement, he kindled the candle at the lamp's low flame, and made his way towards the staircase.</p> <p>He went softly up, the candlestick held in one hand, his portmanteau in the other, and his greatcoat flung over his shoulder. No creaking stair betrayed him, but as he rounded the bend in the second flight a door opened on the floor above, and a voice said anxiously: &#x2018;Evelyn?'</p> <p>He looked up, seeing, in the light of a bedroom-candle held aloft in a fragile hand, a feminine form enveloped in a cloud of lace, which was caught together by ribbons of the palest green satin. From under a nightcap of charming design several ringlets the colour of ripe corn had been allowed to escape. The gentleman on the stairs said appreciatively: &#x2018;What a fetching cap, love!'</p> <p>The vision thus addressed heaved a sigh of relief, but said, with a gurgle of laughter: &#x2018;You absurd boy! Oh, Evelyn, I'm so thankful you've come, but what in the world has detained you? I've been sick with apprehension!'</p> <p>There was a quizzical gleam in the gentleman's eyes, but he said in accents of deep reproach: &#x2018;Come, come, Mama !'</p> <p>&#x2018;It may be very well for you to say Come, come, Mama,' she retorted, &#x2018;but when you faithfully promised to return not a day later than ' She broke off, staring down at him in sudden doubt.</p> <p>Abandoning the portmanteau, the gentleman shrugged the greatcoat from his shoulder, pulled off his hat, and mounted the remaining stairs two at a time, saying still more reproachfully: &#x2018;No, really, Mama! How can you be so unnatural a parent?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Kit!' uttered his unnatural parent, in a smothered shriek. &#x2018;Oh, my darling, my dearest son!'</p> <p>Mr Fancot, receiving his widowed mama on his bosom, caught her in a comprehensive hug, but said, on a note of laughter: &#x2018;Oh, what a rapper! I'm not your dearest son!'</p> <p>Standing on tiptoe to kiss his lean cheek, and dropping wax from her tilted candle down the sleeve of his coat, Lady Denville replied with dignity that she had never felt the smallest preference for either of her twin sons.</p> <p>&#x2018;Of course not! How should you, when you can't tell us apart?' said Mr Fancot, prudently removing the candlestick from her grasp.</p> <p>&#x2018;I can tell you apart!' she declared. &#x2018;If I had expected to see you I should have recognized you instantly! The thing was, I thought you were in Vienna.'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, I'm here,' said Mr Fancot, smiling lovingly down at her. &#x2018;Stewart gave me leave of absence: are you pleased?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, no, not a bit!' she said, tucking her hand in his arm, and drawing him into her bedchamber. &#x2018;Let me look at you, wicked one! Oh, I can't see you properly! Light all the candles, dearest, and then we may be comfortable. The money that is spent on candles in this house! I shouldn't have thought it possible if Dinting hadn't shown me the chandler's bill which, I must say, I wish she had not, for what, I ask you, Kit, is the use of knowing the cost of candles? One must have them, after all, and even your father never desired me to purchase tallow ones.'</p> <p>&#x2018;I suppose one might burn fewer,' remarked Kit, applying a taper to some half-dozen which stood in two chandeliers on the dressing-table.</p> <p>&#x2018;No, no, nothing more dismal than an ill-lit room! Light the ones on the mantelpiece, dearest! Yes, that is much better! Now come and tell me all about yourself!'</p> <p>She had drifted over to an elegant day-bed, and patted it invitingly, but Kit did not immediately obey the summons. He stood looking about him at the scene he had illumined, exclaiming: &#x2018;Why, how is this, Mama? You were used to live in a rose-garden, and now one would think oneself at the bottom of the sea!'</p> <p>As this was the impression she had hoped to create when, at stupendous cost, she had had the room redecorated in varying shades of green, she was pleased, and said approvingly: &#x2018;Exactly so! I can't think how I endured those commonplace roses for so long particularly when poor Mr Brummell told me years ago that I was one of the few females whom green becomes better than any other colour.'</p> <p>&#x2018;It does,' he agreed. His eyes alighted on the bed, and crinkled at the corners as he saw that the billowing curtains were of gauze. &#x2018;Very dashing! Improper, too.'</p> <p>An enchanting ripple of laughter broke from her. &#x2018;Fudge! Do you think the room pretty?'</p> <p>He came to sit beside her, raising her hands to his lips, and planting a kiss in its palm. &#x2018;Yes, like yourself: pretty and absurd!'</p> <p>&#x2018;And like you!' she retorted.</p> <p>He dropped her hand, not unnaturally revolted. &#x2018;Good God ! No, Mama!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, absurd, at all events,' she amended, thinking, however, that it would have been impossible to have found two more handsome men than her twin sons.</p> <p>The Polite World, to which they belonged, would have said, more temperately, that the Fancot twins were a good-looking pair, but by no means as handsome as had been their father. Neither had inherited the classical regularity of his features: they favoured their mother; and although she was an accredited Beauty dispassionate persons were agreed that her loveliness lay not so much in any perfection of countenance as in her vivacious charm. This, asserted her more elderly admirers, was comparable to the charm of the Fifth Duke of Devonshire's first wife. There were other points of resemblance between her and the Duchess: she adored her children, and she was recklessly extravagant.</p> <p>As for Kit Fancot, at four-and-twenty he was a well-built young man, slightly above the average height, with good shoulders, and an excellent leg for the prevailing fashion of skin-tight pantaloons. He was darker than his mother, his glossy locks showing more chestnut than gold; and there was a firmness about his mouth which hers lacked. But his eyes were very like hers: lively, their colour between blue and gray, and laughter rarely far from them. He had her endearing smile as well; and this, with his easy unaffected manners, made him a general favourite. He was as like his brother as fourpence to a groat, only those most intimately acquainted with them being able to tell them apart. What difference there was did not lie perceptibly in feature or in stature, unless they were stood side by side, when it could be seen that Kit was a shade taller than Evelyn, and that Evelyn's hair showed a trifle more burnished gold than Kit's. Only the very discerning could detect the real difference between them, for it was subtle, and one ...</p></p><h2>Complete Guide to Acrylic Painting</h2><p>Numerous plates combined with detailed instructions and technical exercises illustrate acrylic painting methods and materials</p><p></p><h2>African Cities and Towns Before the European Conquest</h2><p>An analytical and comparative survey of major urban centers south of the Sahara during the thousand years before European colonization, examining their governments, economics, societies, and arts</p><p>This richly illustrated book traces the precolonial development of African towns, cities, and architecture south of the Sahara.

Over 300,000 copies of her novels are in print, and profiles of her life appeared in both The <i>New Yorker</i> and The <i>New York Times Magazine</i>. In 1979, her novel <i>Offshore </i>won Britain's Booker Prize, and in 1998 she won the National Book Critics Circle Prize for <i>The Blue Flower</i>. Though Fitzgerald embarked on her literary career when she was in her 60's, her career was praised as "the best argument ...&nbsp;for a publishing debut made late in life" (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>). She told the <i>New York Times</i> Magazine, "In all that time, I could have written books and I didn&#x2019;t. I think you can write at any time of your life." Dinitia Smith, in her <i>New York Times</i> Obituary of May 3, 2000, quoted Penelope Fitzgerald from 1998 as saying, "I have remained true to my deepest convictions, I mean to the courage of those who are born to be defeated, the weaknesses of the strong, and the tragedy of misunderstandings and missed opportunities, which I have done my best to treat as comedy, for otherwise how can we manage to bear it?"</p><h2>K is For Kitten</h2><p>Rosie is just a scrawny alley kitten, but she's braver than she looks-and that's a good thing, because when a little girl brings her home, Rosie will meet the family dog, confront wild animals, be fooled by her reflection and find herself out on a limb.

She lives in New York.reSchool-This alphabet book tells the story of Miss Rosie, a kitten rescued from an alley by a little girl. The simple rhyming text describes her adventures and learning experiences from lapping cream or falling into the pond to going to the vet. Each letter is given a four-line verse and highlighted in a larger font in uppercase. The illustrative word can be a noun, a verb, or "Oops" and "ZZzz's." Jeffers's gouache and colored-ink illustrations are enchanting. This feline is a soft, yellow tabby with big green eyes that just about jumps off the page into readers' arms so that they can feel its fur. There are many interesting points to discuss with children, such as the different insects on the "I" spread. The beauty of the book is in its simplicity and veracity. The little girl poised to lap the milk out of the saucer to teach the kitten is typical of a child. Better yet, with yawning girl, kitten, and dog, "Y is for Yawn" makes this a perfect bedtime story. The book is best for one-on-one reading, but the pictures are large enough to use a short rhyme or two in a storytime setting.

African American Studies. "Probably the real story of race in the United States (like all real stories) can only be written by a poet. And Shane McCrae has done it. BLOOD is an epic that spans three centuries. BLOOD is so formally innovative that you don't quite understand how it achieves its effects. BLOOD is so utterly clear it makes you cry. BLOOD is almost impossibly empathetic. Moving from sequences based on slave narratives and Federal Writers Project oral histories to monologues by white racists to autobiography and the poet's family history, BLOOD is beautiful and significant, subtle and blunt. It asks to be read and reread. We need this book."&#x2014;Kathleen Ossip</p><p>Shane McCrae is the author of FORGIVENESS FORGIVENESS (Factory Hollow Press, 2014), NONFICTION (Black Lawrence Press, 2014), BLOOD (Noemi Press, 2013), and MULE (Cleveland State University Poetry Center, 2010), and the chapbooks IN CANAAN (Rescue Press, 2011) and <em>One Neither One</em> (Octopus Books, 2009). He has received a Whiting Writing's Award, a fellowship from the NEA, and the 2017 Lannan Literary Award for Poetry. He teaches at Oberlin College and in the brief-residency MFA program at Spalding University.Starred Review. McCrae's second collection is a stunning lyric exegesis of blood, showing the blood in our bodies to be a text that inscribes the self with its legacy, life force, violence, and death. Bracketed by accounts of a slave uprising, the collection begins with the impaled heads of insurgents, &#x20ac;&#x153;The white men recognized them mounted them/ to make the air/ Rotten and come from them/ Rotten/ the meat in their necks hanging down/ Like ivy on the gates of heaven,&#x20ac; and ends with the knowledge that &#x20ac;&#x153;...you kill a man you can't// murder him forever/ not even for that stretch of forever/ white folks own.&#x20ac; Throughout, McCrae draws on historical works, both primary accounts and scholarly texts, moving from an acutely brutal and keenly empathetic series of poems in the voice of a slave who has attempted escape with her family, to poems based on ex-slaves' narratives and accounts of lynching and the voices of white racists. McCrae's poetic line engages document and testimony with remarkable urgency and empathy while materializing the rift and trauma embedded in these histories. The collection makes its final shift into autobiography in a set of poems addressed to an estranged brother. As the poet's gaze turns inward, the sense of selfhood seems to reach necessarily beyond the individual: &#x20ac;&#x153;Our bodies we is always walking leaking/ like a ghost can't be a body in one place.&#x20ac; (August)</p><h2>Winnie Ille Pu: 2 (Latin and English Edition)</h2><p>A Latin reader based on the story of Christopher Robin and the bear, Winnie-the-Pooh</p><p>The author of this translation, Alexandro Lenardo, is a pseudonym for Alexander Lenard. Alexander Lenard was not Italian. He was Hungarian. His name in Hungarian was L�n�rd S�ndor. Alexander Leonard was born Budapest, Hungary on 9 March 1910. He was fluent in several languages and wrote many books in those languages. He wrote fiction and non-fiction in German, Latin, Hungarian, Italian and English. Winnie Ille Pu was written in Brazil in 1958. Alexander Leonard wrote it for the daughter of one of his students to help her learn Latin. He apparently never imagined that the book would be published, much less that it would become a best seller. Winnie Ille Pu was originally self-published in Brazil. The book we see here is not the original publication. In 1920, the L�n�rd family moved from Hungary to Austria. S�ndor conducted his medical studies at the University of Vienna. After the 1938 &#34;Anschluss&#34; with Germany, he escaped to Italy. During World World II, he escaped the attention of the Fascist regime by leaving no &#34;paper trail&#34; (identity card, ration card, etc.). He survived by trading his medical services for food and shelter. His leisure hours were spent in the Vatican library, reading texts in Latin until it became a colloquial language to him. His brother K�roly died in 1944 in a Nazi labor camp while his sister settled in England. In 1951 he emigrated to Brazil, where he won the S�o Paulo Television Bach competition in 1956. He settled in the Dona Emma valley, where he bought a small farm with a house he made &#34;invisible&#34; by surrounding it with his favorite trees.

His first novel, <i>Back Bay, </i>introduced Boston treasure hunter Peter Fallon, who is still tracking artifacts across the landscape of our national imagination. Martin's subsequent novels, including <i>Harvard Yard</i>,<i> Citizen Washington</i>, and <i>The Lost Constitution </i>have established him, as a "storyteller whose smoothness matches his ambition." (Publishers Weekly) He has also written an award-winning PBS documentary and one of the cheesiest horror movies ever made. Nevertheless, he was the recipient of the 2005 New England Book Award, given to "an author whose body of work stands as a significant contribution to the culture of the region."

If he was euphoric, and those who observed him that day attested later that he was, euphoria did not express itself either.</p><p>The letter lacked the poetry of his best speeches and demonstrated none of the cold and relentless logic of his political writing.</p><p>It was as simple, direct, and as blunt as a cannonball:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dear Lieutenant Hutchinson,</p><p>It comes to my attention that you are still alive. This means that you may still be in possession of something that I believe fell into your hands in the telegraph office three years ago. It would be best if you returned it, considering its potential to alter opinions regarding the difficulties just ended and those that lie ahead. If you do, a presidential pardon will be considered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A. Lincoln.</p><p>&nbsp;Lincoln did not inform his secretary about the letter.</p><p>It was unlikely that he wanted questions regarding correspondence with an officer who had served not only in the field but also in the War Department telegraph office, before coming into significant personal difficulty.</p><p>It would also have appeared strange that Lincoln did not address the letter to Lieutenant Hutchinson. He sent it instead to Private Jeremiah Murphy at the Armory Square Hospital on Seventh Street.</p><p>But even a president had his secrets.</p><p>Lincoln sealed the letter and slipped it into a pile of outgoing correspondence, some to be mailed, some to be hand delivered around the city.</p><p>It was just after eight when his wife appeared in the doorway to his office, where he was finishing a chat with a congressman. She was wearing a white dress with black stripes and a bonnet adorned with pink silk flowers. She had always favored flowers. But she had worn them less and less in the last four years. No woman who had lost a son and two half brothers, no woman who had watched her husband grow old under history&#x2019;s heaviest burden, would be inclined to wear anything but black.&nbsp; Still, flowers and dress did nothing to soften her voice. &#x201c;Mr. Lincoln, would you have us be late?&#x201d;</p><p>He said, &#x201c;To night, we shall laugh.&#x201d;</p><p>Then he called for his carriage, and they went to the theater.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><b></b>&nbsp;<b>ONE</b><br><b><i>Friday Night</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Peter Fallon received a copy of that letter as an attachment to an e-mail on the third Friday night of September.<br>He would not have read it, except that it came from Diana Wilmington, an assistant professor at the George Washington University and author of a controversial new book, <i>The Racism and Resolve of Abraham Lincoln.</i> The book had gotten her onto television, radio, magazine covers, and made her one of the most recognizable African American scholars in the country. Peter had also dated her when she was an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been thinking of you,&#x201d; she wrote. &#x201c;I still read the Boston gossip pages. (How could I not, after the gossip we inspired?) So that bit about you and Evangeline caught my eye. Not getting married but still having a reception&nbsp;... genius.&#x201d;<br><i>Yes,</i> thought Peter. <i>Genius.</i> The hall had been rented and the champagne was cold. It was a great party. As for the decision not to get married&nbsp;... he was not so sure.<br>He took a sip of wine and kept reading:<br>&#x201c;I really liked Evangeline. I thought she was good for you.&#x201d;<br>True. Peter couldn&#x2019;t remember which of them first said, &#x201c;If it works don&#x2019;t fix it.&#x201d; But now, Evangeline was prepping a new project in New York, and Peter was guest-curating a new exhibit in Boston.<br>&#x201c;However,&#x201d; Diana went on, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not writing about your love life. I&#x2019;d like you to take a look at this attachment.&#x201d;<br>Peter clicked to the scanned image of a letter. He glanced first at the header, printed in an Old English typeface: &#x201c;Executive Mansion.&#x201d; Beneath it was the word &#x201c;Washington,&#x201d; the date April 14, 1865, and to the side, the word &#x201c;Private&#x201d; handwritten and circled. Then Peter&#x2019;s eye dropped to the signature, to the clear and characteristic cursive that was the Holy Grail of autograph collectors everywhere: <i>A. Lincoln.</i><br>In an instant, he knew that whatever this was, it was worth seven figures: a Lincoln signature, on a Lincoln letter, written from the Lincoln White House.<br>Then he looked again at the date and felt a chill: <i>the day Lincoln was shot.</i><br>He wiped the sweat from his palms, as if he were touching the original instead of seeing it on a computer screen. He almost went looking for white cotton curatorial gloves.<br>Could this be Lincoln&#x2019;s last letter? A last insight into the most analyzed, adulated, biographied, beloved, and, in a few places, detested man in American history? And what did this anonymous lieutenant have that mattered so much at the end of the Civil War?<br>Peter clicked again on the e-mail:<br>I held this letter in my hands a week ago, along with the envelope addressed to a Corporal Jeremiah Murphy. A man was offering it for sale to the American Museum of Emancipation. I told him we were very small, hoping to consolidate with the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture when it opens in 2015, but that I would talk to our board. When I tried to contact him two days ago, he had gone incommunicado. I had been planning to ask you to appraise the letter. Would you be willing to put your skills to finding it, or at least uncovering the story behind it?<br>Peter lifted the wine bottle. One more tip into the glass would bring him to the bottom of the label. When he drank alone&#x2014;something he&#x2019;d been doing more since the wedding that wasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;he had a rule: Drink to the bottom of the label and no farther. Stopper the bottle. And every few nights, finish the high-quality dregs. So he poured a bit more, swirled, and sipped.<br>Then he wrote back:<br>The last big Lincoln letter to come on the market was his answer to the so-called Little People&#x2019;s Petition. It went for 3.2m in &#x2019;09. That&#x2019;s where the bidding starts on this, if it&#x2019;s authentic. So call me. I&#x2019;m up until midnight.<br>Then he drank the wine with a little wedge of �poisses: a big cab with a big cheese, an excellent nightcap. And NESN was nightcapping an excellent Red Sox game, which he missed because he had been working on a new exhibit for the Boston Public Library: &#x201c;A Northern City and the Civil War.&#x201d;<br>It was opening on September 22, the 150th anniversary of the day Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation. The Leventhal Center was providing battle maps. Rare Books was delivering journals and photos from the famed Twentieth Regiment Collection. Peter was contributing a few things from his Antiquaria catalog, including a presentation copy of Walt Whitman&#x2019;s <i>Memoranda During the War,</i> inscribed to Ralph Waldo Emerson. And an anonymous lender was offering a signed copy of the Emancipation Proclamation itself.<br>Peter was doing more than guest curators usually did. He considered it a signal honor from his city, so he wanted to earn it.<br>And Boston was more than his city. It was his <i>town</i>.<br>He had his roots in Southie. He&#x2019;d gone to BC High and Harvard. He ran his business from the third floor of a Newbury Street bowfront that was above an art gallery that was above a restaurant. He had Red Sox season tickets and sat on the boards of two Boston museums. And he could never imagine moving to New York, no matter how much he liked to visit.<br>Evangeline had decided that she didn&#x2019;t want to live anywhere <i>but</i> New York, which made marriage a problem and led them to face a hard truth: They both liked their independence, no matter how much they loved each other.<br>So they&#x2019;d had a party instead of a wedding and settled for status quo ante. No sharing of utility bills or toothpaste, no extracurricular sharing of themselves, either.<br>While he waited for Diana Wilmington to call, Peter e-mailed Evangeline:<br>See you Sunday. We&#x2019;ll have fun on the battlefields.<br>Then he poured the rest of the wine.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><i>How did we decide that a little thing like a city would keep us apart?</i><br>That was what Evangeline Carrington was thinking as she rode a taxi down the West Side the next morning.

Nancy was sitting at the table with a still-sleepy Missy on her lap. Michael was eating his breakfast in his poised, reflective way. </p><p> Ray tousled Mike's head and leaned over to kiss Missy. Nancy smiled up at him. She was so darn pretty. There were fine lines around those blue eyes, but you'd still never take her for thirty-two. Ray was only a few years older himself, but always felt infinitely her senior. Maybe it was that awful vulnerability. He noticed the traces of red at the roots of her dark hair. A dozen times in the last year he'd wanted to ask her to let it grow out, but hadn't dared. </p><p> "Happy birthday, honey," he said quietly. </p><p> He watched as the color drained from her face. </p><p> Michael looked surprised. "Is it Mommy's birthday? You didn't tell me that." </p><p> Missy sat upright. "Mommy's birthday?" She sounded pleased. </p><p> "Yes," Ray told them. Nancy was staring down at the table. "And tonight we're going to celebrate. Tonight I'm going to bring home a big birthday cake and a present, and we'll have Aunt Dorothy come to dinner. Right, Mommy?" </p><p> "Ray...no." Nancy's voice was low and pleading. </p><p> "Yes. Remember, last year you promised that this year we'd..." </p><p> Celebrate was the wrong word. He couldn't say it. But for a long time he'd known that they would someday have to start changing the pattern of her birthdays. At first she'd withdrawn completely from him and gone around the house or walked the beach like a silent ghost in a world of her own. </p><p> But last year she'd finally begun to talk about them...the two other children. She'd said, "They'd be so big now...ten and eleven. I try to think how they would look now, but can't seem to even imagine....Everything about that time is so blurred. Like a nightmare that I only dreamed." </p><p> "It's supposed to be like that," Ray told her. "Put it all behind you, honey. Don't even wonder what happened anymore." </p><p> The memory strengthened his decision. He bent over Nancy and patted her hair with a gesture that was at once protective and gentle. </p><p> Nancy looked up at him. The appeal on her face changed to uncertainty. "I don't think -- " </p><p> Michael interrupted her. "How old are you, Mommy?" he asked practically. </p><p> Nancy smiled -- a real smile that miraculously eased the tension. "None of your business," she told him. </p><p> Ray took a quick gulp of her coffee. "Good girl," he said. "Tell you what, Mike. I'll pick you up after school this afternoon and we'll go get a present for Mommy. Now I'd better get out of here. Some guy is coming up to see the Hunt place. I want to get the file together." </p><p> "Isn't it rented?" Nancy asked. </p><p> "Yes. That Parrish fellow who's taken the apartment on and off has it again. But he knows we have the right to show it anytime. It's a great spot for a restaurant and wouldn't take much to convert. It'll make a nice commission if I sell it." </p><p> Nancy put Missy down and walked with him to the door. He kissed her lightly and felt her lips tremble under his. How much had he upset her by starting this birthday talk? Some instinct made him want to say, <i>Let's not wait for tonight. I'll stay home and we'll take the kids and go to Boston for the day.</i> </p><p> Instead he got into his car, waved, backed up and drove onto the narrow dirt lane that wound through an acre of woods until it terminated on the cross-Cape road that led to the center of Adams Port and his office. </p><p> Ray was right, Nancy thought as she walked slowly back to the table. There was a time to stop following the patterns of yesterday -- a time to stop remembering and look only to the future. She knew that a part of her was still frozen. She knew that the mind dropped a protective curtain over painful memories -- but it was more than that. </p><p> It was as though her life with Carl were a blur...the entire time. It was hard to remember the faculty house on the campus, Carl's modulated voice...Peter and Lisa. What had they looked like? Dark hair, both of them, like Carl's, and too quiet...too subdued...affected by her uncertainty...and then lost -- both of them. </p><p> "Mommy, why do you look so sad?" Michael gazed at her with Ray's candid expression, spoke with Ray's directness. </p><p> <i>Seven years,</i> Nancy thought. Life was a series of seven-year cycles. Carl used to say that your whole body changed in that time. Every cell renewed itself. It was time for her to really look ahead...to forget. </p><p> She glanced around the large, cheerful kitchen with the old brick fireplace, the wide oak floors, the red curtains and valances that didn't obstruct the view over the harbor. And then she looked at Michael and Missy.... </p><p> "I'm not sad, darling," she said. "I'm really not." </p><p> She scooped Missy up in her arms, feeling the warmth and sweet stickiness of her. "I've been thinking about your present," Missy said. Her long strawberry-blond hair curled around her ears and forehead. People sometimes asked where she got that beautiful hair -- who had been the redhead in the family? </p><p> "Great," Nancy told her. "But think about it outside. You'd better get some fresh air soon. It's supposed to rain later and get very cold." </p><p> After the children were dressed, she helped them on with their windbreakers and hats. "There's my dollar," Michael said with satisfaction as he reached into the breast pocket of his jacket. "I was sure I left it here. Now I can buy you a present." </p><p> "Me has money too." Missy proudly held up a handful of pennies. "Oh, now, you two shouldn't be carrying your money out," Nancy told them. "You'll only lose it. Let me hold it for you." </p><p> Michael shook his head. "If I give it to you, I might forget it when I go shopping with Daddy." </p><p> "I promise I won't let you forget it." </p><p> "My pocket has a zipper. See? I'll keep it in that, and I'll hold Missy's for her." </p><p> "Well..." Nancy shrugged and gave up the discussion. She knew perfectly well that Michael wouldn't lose the dollar. He was like Ray, well organized. "Now, Mike, I'm going to straighten up. You be sure to stay with Missy." </p><p> "Okay," Michael said cheerfully. "Come on, Missy. I'll push you on the swing first." </p><p> Ray had built a swing for the children. It was suspended from a branch of the massive oak tree at the edge of the woods behind their house. </p><p> Nancy pulled Missy's mittens over her hands. They were bright red; fuzzy angora stitching formed a smile face on their backs. "Leave these on," she told her; "otherwise your hands will get cold. It's really getting raw. I'm not even sure you should go out at all." </p><p> "Oh, please!" Missy's lip began to quiver. </p><p> "All right, all right, don't go into the act," Nancy said hastily. "But not more than half an hour." </p><p> She opened the back door and let them out, then shivered as the chilling breeze enveloped her. She closed the door quickly and started up the staircase. The house was an authentic old Cape, and the stairway was almost totally vertical. Ray said that the old settlers must have had a bit of mountain goat in them the way they built their staircases. But Nancy loved everything about this place. </p><p> She could still remember the feeling of peace and welcome it had given her when she'd first seen it, over six years ago. She'd come to the Cape after the conviction had been set aside. The District Attorney hadn't pressed for a new trial because Rob Legler, his vital prosecution witness, had disappeared. </p><p> She'd fled here, completely across the continent -- as far away from California as she could get; as far away from the people she'd known and the place she'd lived and the college and the whole academic community there. She never wanted to see them again -- the friends who had turned out not to be friends but hostile strangers who spoke of "poor Carl" because they blamed his suicide on her too. </p><p> She'd come to Cape Cod because she'd always heard that New Englanders and Cape people were reticent and reserved and wanted nothing to do with strangers, and that was good. She needed a place to hide, to find herself, to sort it all out, to try to think through what had happened, to try to come back to life. </p><p> She'd cut her hair and dyed it sable brown, and that was enough to make her look completely different from the pictures that had front-paged newspapers all over the country during the trial. </p><p> She guessed that only fate could have prompted her to select Ray's real estate office when she went looking for a house to rent. She'd actually made an appointment with another realtor, but on impulse she'd gone in to see him first because she liked his hand-lettered sign and the window boxes that were filled with yellow and champagne mums. </p><p> She had waited until he finished with another client -- a leathery-faced old man with thick, curling hair -- and admired the way Ray advised him to hang on to his property, that he'd find a tenant for the apartment in the house to help carry expenses. </p><p> After the old man left she said, "Maybe I'm here at the right time. I want to rent a house." </p><p> But he wouldn't even show her the old Hunt place. "The Lookout is too big, too lonesome and too drafty for you," he said. "But I just got in a rental on an authentic Cape in excellent condition that's fully furnished. It can even be bought eventually, if you like it. How much room do you need, Miss...Mrs....?" </p><p> "Miss Kiernan," she told him. "Nancy Kiernan." Instinctively she used her mother's maiden name. "Not much, really. I won't be having company or visitors." </p><p> She liked the fact that he didn't pry or even look curious. "The Cape is a good place to come when you want to be by yourself," he said. "You can't be lonesome walking on the beach or watching the sunset or just looking out the window in the morning." </p><p> Then Ray had brought her up here, and immediately she knew that she would stay. The combination family and dining room had been fashioned from the old keeping room that had once been the heart of the house. She loved the rocking chair in front of the fireplace and the way the table was in front of the windows so that it was possible to eat and look down over the harbor and the bay. </p><p> She was able to move in right away, and if Ray wondered why she had absolutely nothing except the two suitcases she'd taken off the bus, he didn't show it. She said that her mother had died and she had sold their home in Ohio and decided to come East. She simply omitted talking about the six years that had lapsed in between. </p><p> That night, for the first time in months, she slept through the night -- a deep, dreamless sleep in which she didn't hear Peter and Lisa calling her; wasn't in the courtroom listening to Carl condemn her. </p><p> That first morning here, she'd made coffee and sat by the window. It had been a clear, brilliant day -- the cloudless sky purple-blue; the bay tranquil and still; the only movement the arc of sea gulls hovering near the fishing boats. </p><p> With her fingers wrapped around the coffee cup, she'd sipped and watched. The warmth of the coffee had flowed through her body. The sunbeams had warmed her face. The tranquillity of the scene enhanced the calming sense of peace that the long, dreamless sleep had begun. </p><p> <i>Peace...give me peace.</i> That had been her prayer during the trial; in prison. <i>Let me learn to accept.</i> Seven years ago... </p><p> Nancy sighed, realizing that she was still standing by the bottom step of the staircase. It was so easy to get lost in remembering. That was why she tried so hard to live each day...not look back or into the future. </p><p> She began to go upstairs slowly. How could there ever be peace for her, knowing that if Rob Legler ever showed up they'd try her again for murder; take her away from Ray and Missy and Michael? For an instant, she dropped her face into her hands. <i>Don't think about it,</i> she told herself. <i>It's no use.</i> </p><p> At the head of the stairs she shook her head determinedly and walked quickly into the master bedroom. She threw open the windows and shivered as the wind blew the curtains back against her. Clouds were starting to form, and the water in the bay had begun to churn with whitecaps. The temperature was dropping rapidly. Nancy was enough of a Cape person now to know that a cold wind like this usually blew in a storm. </p><p> But it really was still clear enough to have the children out. She liked them to have as much fresh air as possible in the morning. After lunch, Missy napped and Michael went to kindergarten. </p><p> She started to pull the sheets from the big double bed and hesitated. Missy had been sniffling yesterday. Should she go down and warn her not to unzip the neck of her jacket? It was one of her favorite tricks. Missy always complained that all her clothes felt too tight at the neck. </p><p> Nancy deliberated an instant, then pulled the sheets completely back and off the bed. Missy had on a turtleneck shirt. Her throat would be covered even if she undid the button. Besides, it would take only ten or fifteen minutes to strip and change the beds and turn on a wash. </p><p> Ten minutes at the most, Nancy promised herself, to quiet the nagging feeling of worry that was insistently telling her to go out to the children <i>now.</i> </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 1975 by Mary Higgins Clark</p></p><h2>Complete Chess Strategy, Volume 2: Principles of Pawn Play and the Center</h2><p>For New condition books; You will be the first to open the book cover.

A statement in Herodotus gives ground for thinking that he was a slave belonging to a citizen of Samos called Iadmon. Legend says that he was ugly and misshapen. There are many references to Aesop found in the Athenian writers: Aristophanes, Xenophon, Plato, Aristotle and others. It is not known whether he wrote down his <b>Fables</b> himself, nor indeed how many of them are correctly attributed to his invention.</p><b>From D. L Asliman's Introduction to <i>Aesop's Fables</i></b><p> Don&#x2019;t count your chickens before they are hatched!&#x201d; He is a wolf in sheep&#x2019;s clothing.&#x201d; She has a sour-grapes attitude.&#x201d; They are killing the goose that laid the golden eggs.&#x201d; He demands the lion&#x2019;s share.&#x201d; Don&#x2019;t be like the boy who called wolf!&#x2019;&#x201d; These expressions are so much a part of our everyday language and culture that they seem to have been with us forever, and that is almost the case, for the fables that produced these proverbial sayings are indeed even older than (to name but three) the modern English, French, and German languages where today they are so much at home. The fables behind these sayings are those of arguably the most famous storyteller of all time, the legendary Aesop. Who was the man who created these timeless literary gems?</p><b>The Man Aesop</b><p>Aesop (sometimes spelled �sop, �sopus, Esop, Esope, or using the Greek form of his name Aisopos) has been known in history and in legend since the fifth century b.c., or earlier, as a gifted Greek storyteller and the author of the world&#x2019;s best-known collection of fables. However, it cannot be proven with any degree of certainty that he existed as a real person. Most modern scholars believe that Aesop was instead a name invented, already in antiquity, to provide attribution for a body of oral tales whose true authors were a number of anonymous storytellers. Martin Luther expressed this view some 500 years ago: Attributing these stories to Aesop is, in my opinion, itself a fiction. Perhaps there has never been on earth a man by the name of Aesop&#x201d; (quoted in Jacobs, <i>History of the Aesopic Fabl</i>, p. 15; see For Further Reading&#x201d;).</p><p>Although it is possible that there was indeed a gifted Greek storyteller by the name of Aesop, his reputation expanded to legendary proportions in the decades and centuries following his death, and with time many more stories and deeds were credited to him than he could have composed and performed. Supporting this view, many of the earliest references to the stories of Aesop refer to Aesopic (or Aesopian) fables rather than Aesop&#x2019;s fables. In other words, Aesopic, an adjective, describes a kind of story and a literary tradition but does not claim to identify a specific author.</p><p>One thing is certain: Aesop, if he existed at all, did not leave behind a collection of written fables. His reputation is that of an oral storyteller, not an author of written literature. The oldest references to his fables refer to tales memorized and retold, not written and read. For example, from Aristophanes&#x2019;s comedy <i>Wasps</i> (written in 422 b.c.) we learn that telling anecdotes and comic stories in the style of Aesop was common entertainment at banquets in ancient Athens. More seriously, in 360 b.c. Plato recorded in his dialog <i>Phaedo</i> (section 61b) that Socrates, under sentence of death in prison, diverted himself by reformulating some of Aesop&#x2019;s fables. Plato&#x2019;s Phaedo quotes Socrates himself: I took some fables of Aesop, which I had ready at hand and knew, and turned them into verse.&#x201d; The doomed philosopher did not have a book or manuscript of Aesop&#x2019;s fables in prison with him, if such a book or manuscript even existed at the time. He knew the fables from memory, as did the partygoers in Aristophanes&#x2019;s comedy.</p><p>The most frequently cited ancient reference to the man Aesop is found in the <i>History</i> of the Greco-Persian Wars written by the Greek historian Herodotus about 425 b.c. Here we learn that Aesop, the fable writer, was a slave of Iadmon, son of Hephaestopolis, a Samian, and that Iadmon&#x2019;s grandson (also named Iadmon) claimed and received compensation for the murder of Aesop. If this account is true, Aesop would have lived during the sixth century b.c. Apart from this sketchy biography, Herodotus recorded essentially no additional details about the fable writer.</p><p>However, later Greek and Roman writers were not so reticent. One body of literature is particularly relevant in this regard. Usually referred to as <i>The Life of Aesop</i>, this work has survived in a number of medieval manuscripts by different anonymous compilers and is based on earlier accounts, now lost. The statements about Aesop&#x2019;s life history contained in the different versions of this work often contradict one another, or they are so miraculous and fantastic as to be unbelievable by modern standards.</p><p>The ultimate source of these accounts is undoubtedly folklore: anonymous legends told and retold by generations of oral storytellers. <i>The Life of Aesop</i> is today generally held to be fiction, but as is the case with many legends, there could be at least a kernel of truth in one or more of the episodes. The following biographical outline has been gleaned from different versions of <i>The Life of Aesop</i>, most prominently the accounts published by Lloyd W. Daly in his <i>Aesop without Morals</i> (pp. 31 90) and the <i>Everyman&#x2019;s Library</i> version of <i>Aesop: Fables</i> (pp. 17 45).</p><p>Aesop was born a slave, or possibly was captured into slavery at an early age. His birthplace is variously stated as Thrace, Phrygia, Ethiopia, Samos, Athens, or Sardis. He was dark-skinned. In fact, it is said that his name was derived from <i>Aethiop</i> (Ethiopian). He was physically deformed: a hunchback, pot belly, misshapen head, snub nose, and bandy legs are often mentioned. Although in his early years he suffered from a serious speech impediment, or according to some the inability to speak at all, he was cured through the intervention of a deity and became a gifted orator, especially skillful at incorporating fables into his speeches.</p><p>As a young man Aesop was transported by a slave trader to Ephesus (in modern Turkey). Because of his grotesque appearance, no one there would buy him, so he was taken to the island of Samos, where he was examined by Xanthus, identified in the manuscripts as an eminent philosopher,&#x201d; but a person whose existence cannot be verified historically. At first repulsed by Aesop&#x2019;s appearance, Xanthus changed his mind when the slave proclaimed, A philosopher should value a man for his mind, not for his body.&#x201d; Impressed with Aesop&#x2019;s astuteness, Xanthus purchased him as a manservant for his wife.</p><p>Aesop soon proved himself to be an irreverent and sarcastic trickster with a clever retort for every occasion. The following episode is typical of many others illustrating how Aesop&#x2019;s quick wit saved him from punishment, sometimes deserved, sometimes not: Xanthus, wanting to know what fate awaited him on a particular day, sent Aesop to see if any crows were outside the door. According to popular belief, two crows would portend good fortune, whereas a single crow would be an omen of bad luck. Aesop saw a pair of crows and reported this to his master, who then set forth with good cheer. Upon opening the door, Xanthus saw only a single crow, for one of them had flown away, and he angrily turned on his slave for having tricked him into beginning a dangerous venture. You shall be whipped for this!&#x201d; said Xanthus, and while Aesop was being readied for his punishment a messenger arrived at the door with an invitation for Xanthus to dine with his friends. Your omens have no meaning!&#x201d; cried Aesop. I saw the auspicious pair of crows, yet I am about to be beaten like a dog, whereas you saw the ominous single crow, and you are about to make merry with your friends.&#x201d; Perceiving the irony and the wisdom of this observation, Xanthus released Aesop and spared him the threatened punishment.</p><p>Aesop&#x2019;s cleverness extended from word to deed. An unrepentant trickster, his pranks ranged from tricking his fellow slaves into carrying the heavier burdens to seducing his master&#x2019;s wife with her unwitting husband&#x2019;s apparent blessing. His tricks often were masked by feigned stupidity on his part, which has led commentators to compare him to the German Till Eulenspiegel and the Turkish Nasreddin Hoca, two of the world&#x2019;s most rascally but beloved tricksters.</p><p>Aesop&#x2019;s legendary wisdom and shrewdness sometimes moved into the realm of the supernatural. He could solve seemingly impossible riddles and conundrums, foretell the future with uncanny accuracy, and unerringly discover hidden treasures. A master of human psychology, he understood what motivated people to act, and used this knowledge to manipulate them to his advantage. As his life progressed he moved to ever greater venues: from a trickster in a slave&#x2019;s workroom to a lecturer in a philosopher&#x2019;s auditorium to a diplomat and councilor in the courts of governors and kings.</p><p>With time his cunning, wisdom, and oratory skills brought him freedom from slavery, but in the end they cost him his life. At Delphi the citizens, offended by his lack of respect for their aristocracy and for their principal deity Apollo, planted a golden cup in his baggage, then accused him of temple theft.</p><p>Sentenced to die by being thrown over a cliff, Aesop pleaded his case with a series of fables, one of which was the story of The Mouse, the Frog, and the Hawk&#x201d; (no. 67 in the present collection). In this tale a frog and a mouse go swimming together in a pool with their feet tied together, but the mouse drowns. The frog, burdened by the dead mouse, is now an easy prey for a hawk, which forthwith captures and devours him.</p><p>Aesop compared himself to the mouse and the Delphians to the frog. You may kill me,&#x201d; he predicted, but my unjust death will bring you great misfortune.&#x201d; Aesop was executed near Delphi, and his dire prediction came true. Shortly after his death the region was visited with famine, pestilence, and warfare. The Delphians consulted the Oracle of Apollo as to the source of these calamities, and they received the answer that they were to make amends for the unjust death of Aesop. Accordingly they built there a pyramid in his honor.<br></p></p><h2>Whispers Beyond the Veil (A Change of Fortune Mystery)</h2><p><b>First in a dazzling new historical mystery series featuring Ruby Proulx, a psychic with a questionable past who suddenly finds her future most uncertain...</b><br><br><i>Canada, 1898. </i>The only life Ruby Proulx has ever known is that of a nomad, traveling across the country with her snake-oil salesman father.

Lantern light glinted down on the brown glass bottle held outstretched in his hand. A hot wind pressed and flapped the canvas stretched above his head. Scents of sweat and hay and dusting powder melded in the unseasonably hot air. But Father appeared cool as a slice of iced melon at a picnic. He strutted and strode and worked the already-heated crowd to a fever pitch by calling out all the cures and wonderments Running Bear's Miracle Elixir would provide if only his listeners would part with a dollar.<br><br>Johnny and two other Maliseet men sat in a semicircle around the edge of the stage chanting in low tones, lending a bit of credence to the notion that the cures Father stood hawking were passed on to him by an Indian medicine man.<br><br>"Be amongst those who discover the secrets to lifelong health the red men have guarded for generations. Baldness, wasting diseases, lack of moral fiber? All these and more are banished with no more than a few doses of this potent remedy."<br><br>By the time he'd gotten a testimonial wrung out of the well-paid shills in the audience, I knew we'd sell out and I'd need to mix up another batch of what Father referred to as "Bank in a Bottle."<br><br>"I can't promise we have enough for everyone, so this is a decision you mustn't delay," Father called above the noise of the crowd. All through the tent people scrambled to their feet. Swishing skirts and stomping boots raced past me at the exit. From sleeplessness to lethargy to breathing difficulties, they chattered to each other how they hoped this nostrum would cure them all. Fortunately for Father's wallet we'd be long gone before the rubes realized the bottles' main ingredients were empty promises.<br><br>When the tent cleared, Father came up behind me and whispered in my ear, "Not a bad evening's work, wouldn't you say?" He gave me a wink, then strode toward the line to greet and encourage the customers. I watched a moment longer, then decided I wouldn't be missed if I conducted a bit of business of my own.<br><br>I hurried back to the tent I shared with Father. Aided by a small bit of mirror Father used for shaving, I rubbed a burnt matchstick I saved for just such a purpose along my upper eyelashes and beneath my lower ones. I licked my lips and pressed them against a limp scrap of scarlet crepe paper and completed my costume by unpinning my dark hair and draping my lace shawl over my head.<br><br>I was always astonished at how empowering it was to transform my appearance from that of a medicine man's daughter to a fortune-telling gypsy. In my everyday attire no one would've given a second thought to a thing I said, let alone believed me to know the future. But enfold me in the guise of a foreigner and suddenly I was imbued with magical powers and otherworldly attributes.<br><br>The crowds from the show had made their purchases and were looking for other entertainments when I arrived back at the midway. I took up my usual post at a wooden folding table next to the popular magic lantern show. With a practiced hand I shuffled and cut my well-thumbed deck of divination cards and before long attracted a steady stream of customers.<br><br>I delivered rosy prognostications in a false accent for hopeful young girls and haggard old men. Years of reading the crowds had given me a feeling for what the customer really wanted to know instead of what they had asked. Subtle shifts in posture, tiny tightenings of the muscles around the mouth, widening and narrowing of the eyes all gave away what the stranger across from me held most dear.<br><br>I would have felt guilty taking their money if they went away unhappy, so I made a practice of slanting my predictions to match what they desired. People tend to get what they expect out of life. It alleviated my conscience, at least in part, to help them to expect the best.<br><br>After a couple of hours I was tired and well pleased with my earnings. Just as I had determined to pack up my cards and return to my tent, Johnny slid into the chair opposite me.<br><br>"I hoped I'd find you here." The table was a small one and I felt his leg press up against the layers of fabric covering my knee. I pulled away quickly, as any right-thinking girl would, but not before I noticed his company was not altogether unpleasant.<br><br>"You can't be here for another reading. I just did one for you yesterday." Johnny was my best customer. I had sometimes wondered if he knew how often his extra pennies were the ones that kept my belly from rumbling. Father was shockingly inept at managing money, and I had begun my card readings in the first place to stave off starvation when he had frittered away what little we had on one baseless scheme after another.<br><br>"Yesterday you didn't tell me what I wanted to hear." Johnny leaned across the table.<br><br>"Maybe you should try reading them for yourself for a change," I said, sliding the deck toward him. "You've seen it done enough times. You must know what all the cards mean by now." Johnny's eyebrows lifted as he took the deck from me. He shuffled the cards like the avid faro player he was and carefully cut the deck into three stacks. I held my breath as he turned over the top card on the first stack.<br><br>"I should have tried this myself long ago." Johnny tapped the Wheel of Fortune card. "There's hope for me yet."<br><br>"Remember it's a wheel. What comes around goes around. The wheel represents changing fortunes, not necessarily good luck or bad."<br><br>"It looks like adventure to me." He turned over a second card. "See, definitely an adventure." He placed his long finger on a card with a young man carrying a bundle on a stick.<br><br>"The Fool appears for new beginnings and youthful enthusiasm," I said. "Maybe a new life is coming your way."<br><br>"This last one is the clincher. If I'm lucky it will be a card promising a certain young lady would like to adventure with me." He turned over the last card, and I heard his quick intake of breath. His reaction was a common one, and I couldn't blame him for his apprehension.<br><br>"The Death card is not exactly what it appears," I said, hoping to ease his mind. "It doesn't usually signal the death of the body."<br><br>"What is it, then? The death of hopes and dreams?" Johnny gave me a halfhearted smile.<br><br>"It more often means a total change in your customary way of living. It gives you the opportunity to reinvent your life. For most, it's a very positive card. Taken with the other two, I'd say your life is about to undergo a radical change."<br><br>"You always manage to make everything sound like it will be just fine. I wish there was a way I could make everything turn out fine for you," Johnny said.<br><br>"Everything is fine, Johnny." I swept my hand at the shrinking crowds fading away from the ratty tents. "What more could I want than all this?"<br><br>"Ruby, don't jest. You know I'd give anything to be able to take you away from here."<br><br>"I appreciate the sentiment but you know my place is here with my father. Which reminds me, I should go. I need to replenish our supply of elixir before tomorrow's show." I gathered up the cards and slipped them back into my reticule.<br><br>I had hurried needlessly. It was long past dark when Father returned to our tent that night. He whistled just under his breath and there was a jauntiness to his step that filled me with dread. If it were just the jaunty step my only worry would be the whiskey I could be sure was fueling his mood. Father almost always celebrated a well-received performance with a celebratory bottle or even two. He called it his own version of a miracle in a bottle. Overindulgence generally turned him sentimental and willing to share stories about my mother, a thing he never did whilst sober.<br><br>It was the whistling that worried me. Whistling signaled an idea was foaming and churning just under the surface and he was about to burst forth with it. Whistling was the vanguard of his next grand plan, a thing I learned to fear in the course of my twenty years.<br><br>"Ruby, my love, stop bottling the hooch. We're about to move into a whole new realm of commerce." He reached for my hands and twirled me until my dress billowed and my stomach lurched. Father's good moods were not contagious.<br><br>"Father, I wish you'd stop that. You're making me dizzy."<br><br>"If wishes were horses, my dear. If only they were horses." But stop he did. "From now on we'll have no need for wishes. We'll be staying in the finest hotels instead of hunkering down in a tent hawking bottles for pennies a piece."<br><br>"What would we know about fine hotels?" I asked, hoping to delay him in sharing whatever news had brought such a glow to his cheeks.<br><br>"You'd be surprised at the things I know. I roamed the world for a good many years before you were born, you know. Fine hotels were once one of my specialties."<br><br>"You are a man of mystery, Father." It wouldn't do to tell him how often he had regaled me with stories of how he had swept my mother off her feet in the grand ballroom of a fine hotel. He had only done so when he was so far into his cups he could barely peek over the rim.<br><br>"I hope you are prepared to be rich beyond your wildest imaginings." I didn't bother to mention my wildest imaginings included a home of our own with a garden, roses scrambling along the foundation, and a wide porch overlooking the sea. I took a strengthening breath and played my expected part.<br><br>"How do you propose to make us such a fortune, Father?"<br><br>"I thought you'd never ask. Close your eyes and wait right here while I fetch it." Without another word, Father ducked back out through the tent flap. I did as I was bid, and a moment later I heard him reenter the tent. "Ta-da!" I opened my eyes and blinked.<br><br>"What is that contraption?" Father held a wooden box fitted with shiny bits of copper and black rubber tubes. Sticking out of the side was a handle that appeared to be made for cranking.<br><br>"It is nothing less than the latest in medical miracles." He dashed to the camp table and set the box upon it.<br><br>"Father, I'm not one of the rubes. There's no need to convince me it works." And he didn't. One of the things I liked best about my father was his honesty with me concerning his dishonesty with others.<br><br>"Of course, my dear. Sometimes I forget myself. This is the Invigorizer. It uses an electric current generated by cranking the handle located on the side of the box."<br><br>"But what does it purport to do?" I didn't want to encourage him, but Father exhibited a childish inclination to pout if I didn't share his unbridled enthusiasm for one of his new schemes. When I was very young I thought he truly was a miracle man and believed in him no matter how ill conceived his plans. In the past few years the realization of his fallibility had been more difficult to bear than all of the hunger, cold, or near brushes with the law added together. More and more often I was calling on my own powers of showmanship in order to keep the peace.<br><br>"It stimulates all systems of the body. It revitalizes the mind, purifies the blood, and eliminates melancholia."<br><br>"And you want to start hawking this thing along with the Running Bear's Miracle Elixir?"<br><br>"No, my dear. Instead of selling bottles of spirits flavored with turpentine for pennies apiece, we will be selling these devices for upwards of twenty dollars each. Or for the budget-minded consumer we can offer single treatments for a mere dollar. I see an entire empire building before my very eyes."<br><br>Sometimes Father forgets to turn off his showman side and he manages to con even himself into believing his pitch. It's times like these when I worry. He was going to need to be reined in quickly or we'd be without a penny to our names. It had happened more than once. Unless it was already too late.<br><br>"Is it safe?"<br><br>"Nothing could be more so. You simply place the helmet on the patient's head and then tighten the torso straps across his chest, snugging them down firmly over the heart. You then flip the toggle and a healthful current flows through the patient's body and into the ground."<br><br>"Where did you get this?"<br><br>"I purchased them from a reputable gentleman from Chicago who just happened to be in the area selling them to local doctors."<br><br>"How do you know he's reputable?"<br><br>"He had the bearing and speech of a gentleman and he produced an entire list of testimonials from satisfied patients and doctors on both sides of the border." Father's voice took on a strident note and he crossed his own arms. This would never do.<br><br>"Do you remember the Ludlow's Luxuriant Locks debacle in Toronto?"<br><br>"Please, my dear, this is nothing like that. We can't lose with this opportunity."<br><br>"By the time we were run out of town all the customers were bald."<br><br>"Never mind all that. This is our opportunity to make a mint. If all goes well, eventually I intend to settle down in one place and operate an order by mail business instead of rambling the roads. Wouldn't you like that?" He flashed me one of the smiles that worked so well on the customers, and I felt my resistance fading. Until I remembered something.<br><br>"You said you purchased 'them.' How many of these devices did you buy?" I felt a knot in my stomach pulling firm, like it was lashing a boat to a dock. Father's business sense was appalling.<br><br>"All of them, of course. He insisted I take the lot or he was going to sell them to another qualified buyer."<br><br>"Tell me you haven't spent all the money."<br><br>"Invested, my sweet. I invested every cent."<br><br>"You promised me the last time you'd never do something like this again. There are no valuables left to sell."<br><br>"It's beneath us both for you to remind me of such a thing. Besides, I am absolutely certain the Invigorizer will completely change our lives." A deep blush crept above Father's collar. He no longer looked like the cool salesman who strode the stage only hours before.</p><h2>Field Guide to Stars and Planets (Peterson Field Guide Series)</h2><p>Provides detailed maps and charts and information about stars, nebulae, galaxies, the planets, comets, asteroids, and meteors</p><p>Jay M.

The moon is somewhat more than one-quarter the diameter of the earth. This makes it the largest substantial satellite (moon) in the solar system in comparison to its parent planet. (Three moons of Jupiter and one each of Neptune and Saturn are physically larger than our moon; Pluto&#x2019;s small moon Charon is nearly half Pluto&#x2019;s size.) The moon orbits the earth every 271?3 days with respect to the stars. But during that time, the earth and moon have moved as a system about 1?12 of the way in their yearly orbit around the sun. So if the moon at a certain point in its orbit is directly between the earth and the sun, 271?3 days later it has not quite returned to that point directly between the earth and the sun. The moon must orbit the earth a bit farther to get back to the same place with respect to the line between the earth and the sun. The moon reaches this point in a couple of days, making the synodic period of the moon equal to 291?2 days. (The synodic period is the interval between two successive conjunctions coming to the same celestial longitude of two celestial bodies, in this case conjunctions of the moon and sun as observed from the earth.) It is the synodic months that are taken into account in lunar calendars.<br></p><h2>I Spy Mystery: A Book of Picture Riddles</h2><p>Picture Riddles fill this book; Turn the pages! Take a look!

Royal Flying Corps aircraft reigned almost supreme over the battlefront, and the vaunted Fokker monoplanes had been hounded from the air. In response, an entirely new type of fighting formation came into being - the Jagdstaffel, which was a unit designed solely as a fighting squadron. One of the first, and undoubtedly the most famous, was Jasta 2, formed and led by Germany's premiere fighter ace Oswald Boelcke. Renamed Jasta "Boelcke" by Imperial Decree, the unit would carry its first commander's legacy to spectacular success in late 1918.</p><p>This title examines the tactics, personalities and achievements of this ace squadron which finished the war with a record of 336 victories, second only to Richthofen's own unit in confirmed kills.</p></p><p>A history teacher living in St Charles, Iowa, Greg VanWyngarden has had a lifelong interest in World War I aviation and has been particularly active in researching the colors and markings of German fighter aircraft.

The story of the pilots who carried on after Boelcke died is told here in a very personal and engaging fashion. This book cuts this great story by the unit rather than by aircraft type, and the associated Osprey WWI titles on German airplanes complement this story well.

She thought she heard a voice calling her from outside, but she&#x2019;d been wrong before. It was probably the rushing of the rain, or the lash of the wind through the trees. Still, she listened, hoping.<br>&#x201c;Babe?&#x201d; Sam paused on the stair, resting his hand on the banister. He looked back at her, his eyes a puzzled blue behind his glasses. &#x201c;Did you forget your phone?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, I thought I heard something.&#x201d; Jill didn&#x2019;t elaborate. She was in her forties, old enough to have a past and wise enough to keep her thoughts about it to herself.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Sam asked, patiently. It was almost midnight, and they&#x2019;d been on their way to bed. The house was dark except for the glass fixture above the stairwell, and the silvery strands in Sam&#x2019;s thick, dark hair glinted in the low light. Their chubby golden retriever, Beef, was already upstairs, looking down at them from the landing, his buttery ears falling forward.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing, I guess.&#x201d; Jill started back up the stairs, but Beef swung his head toward the front of the house and gave an excited bark. His tail started to wag, and Jill turned, too, listening again.<br><i>Jill! Jill!</i><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Abby!&#x201d; Jill heard it for sure, this time. The cry resonated in her chest, speaking directly to her heart. She turned around and hurried for the entrance hall, and Beef scampered downstairs after her, his heavy butt getting ahead of him, like a runaway tractor-trailer.<br>&#x201c;Abby who?&#x201d; Sam called after her. &#x201c;Your ex&#x2019;s kid?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Jill reached the front door, twisted the deadbolt, flicked on the porch light, and threw open the door. Abby wasn&#x2019;t there, and Jill didn&#x2019;t see her because it was so dark. There were no streetlights at this end of the block, and the rain obliterated the outlines of the houses and cars, graying out the suburban scene. Suddenly, a black SUV with only one headlight drove past, spotlighting a silhouette that Jill would know anywhere. It was Abby, but she was staggering down the sidewalk as if she&#x2019;d been injured.<br>&#x201c;Sam, call 911!&#x201d; Jill bolted out of the house and into the storm, diagnosing Abby on the fly. It could have been a hit-and-run, or an aneurysm. Not a stroke, Abby was too young. Not a gunshot or stab wound, in this neighborhood.<br>Jill tore through the rain. Beef bounded ahead, barking in alarm. The neighbor&#x2019;s motion-detector went on, casting a halo of light on their front lawn. Abby stumbled off the sidewalk. Her purse slipped from her shoulder and dropped to the ground. Abby took a few more faltering steps, then collapsed, crumpling to the grass.<br>&#x201c;Abby!&#x201d; Jill screamed, sprinting to Abby&#x2019;s side, kneeling down. Abby was conscious, but crying. Jill reached for her pulse and scanned her head and body for signs of injury, and there were none. Rainwater covered Abby&#x2019;s face, streaking her mascara and blackening her tears. Her hair stuck to her neck, and rain plastered her thin sundress to her body. Her pulse felt strong and steady, bewildering Jill. &#x201c;Abby, Abby, what is it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You have to&nbsp;... hold me.&#x201d; Abby raised her arms. &#x201c;Please.&#x201d;<br>Jill gathered Abby close, shielding her from the rain. She&#x2019;d held Abby so many times before, and all the times rushed back at her, as if her very body had stored the memories, until that very moment. Jill flashed on the time Abby had fallen off her Rollerblades, breaking an ankle. Then the time Abby had gotten a C on her trig final. The time she didn&#x2019;t get picked for the travel soccer team. Abby had always been a sensitive little girl, but she wasn&#x2019;t a little girl anymore, and Jill had never seen her cry so hard.<br>&#x201c;Abby, honey, please, tell me, and I can help.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t say it&nbsp;... it&#x2019;s so awful.&#x201d; Abby sobbed, and Jill caught a distinct whiff of alcohol on her breath and came up to speed. Abby wasn&#x2019;t injured, she&#x2019;d been drinking. Jill hadn&#x2019;t seen her in three years, and Abby had grown up; she&#x2019;d be nineteen now. Abby sobbed harder. &#x201c;Jill, Dad&#x2019;s dead&nbsp;... he&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;<i>What?</i>&#x201d; Jill gasped, shocked. Her ex-husband was in excellent health, still in his forties. &#x201c;How?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Somebody&nbsp;... killed him.&#x201d; Abby dissolved into tears, her body going limp, clinging to Jill. &#x201c;Please, you have to&nbsp;... help me. I have to find out&nbsp;... who did it.&#x201d;<br>Jill hugged her closer, feeling her grief and struggling to process what had happened. She couldn&#x2019;t imagine William as a murder victim, or a victim of any kind, for that matter, but her first thought was of his daughters, Abby and Victoria, and her own daughter, Megan. The news would devastate all of them, Megan included. William was her stepfather, but the only father she&#x2019;d ever known. Her real father had died before she was born.<br>&#x201c;Babe, what are you doing? Let&#x2019;s get her into the house!&#x201d; Sam shouted, to be heard over the rain. He was kneeling on Abby&#x2019;s other side, though Jill didn&#x2019;t know when he&#x2019;d gotten there.<br>&#x201c;William&#x2019;s been murdered,&#x201d; Jill told him, sounding numb, even to herself.<br>&#x201c;I heard. We&#x2019;re not calling 911, she&#x2019;s just drunk.&#x201d; Sam squinted against the brightness of the motion-detector light. Raindrops soaked his hair and dappled his polo shirt. &#x201c;Let me take her arm. Lift her on one, two, three,&#x201d; he counted off, tugging Abby&#x2019;s arm.<br>&#x201c;Okay, go.&#x201d; Jill took Abby&#x2019;s other arm, and together they hoisted her, sobbing, to her feet, gathered her purse, and half walked and half carried her toward the house, sloshing through the grass, with Beef at their heels.<br>Jill tried to collect her thoughts, which were in turmoil. She&#x2019;d always dreamed of seeing Abby again, but not in these circumstances, and she dreaded telling Megan about William. But as agonized as she felt for the girls, Jill wouldn&#x2019;t shed a tear for her ex-husband. There was a reason she had divorced the man, and it was a whopper.<br>And evidently, not only the good died young.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2012 by Lisa Scottoline<br></p><h2>Sketch Fantasy Art: A Draw-Inside Step-by-Step Sketchbook (IPSK)</h2><p><p>Learn how to draw fairy and elf faces, angels, mermaids and many more wildly inspiring creatures in this book that provides it's readers with endless tips, advice, and how-to instructions.

Priestley in Penguin Modern Classics. London, 1939, and in the grimy publands of Earls Court, George Harvey Bone is pursuing a helpless infatuation. Netta is cool, contemptuous and hopelessly desirable to George. George is adrift in a drunken hell, except in his &#39;dead&#39; moments, when something goes click in his head and he realizes, without a doubt, that he must kill her. In the darkly comic Hangover Square Patrick Hamilton brilliantly evokes a seedy, fog-bound world of saloon bars, lodging houses and boozing philosophers, immortalising the slang and conversational tone of a whole generation and capturing the premonitions of doom that pervaded London life in the months before the war. Patrick Hamilton (1904-1962) was one of the most gifted and admired writers of his generation. His plays include the thrillers Rope (1929), on which Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s film of the same name was based, and Gas Light (1939), twice successfully adapted for the screen, the second time starring Ingrid Bergman. Among his novels are The Midnight Bell (1929); The Siege of Pleasure (1932); The Plains of Cement (1934); a trilogy entitled Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky (1935), adapted into a BBC mini-series in 2007; Hangover Square (1941); and The West Pier (1951), Mr Stimpson and Mr Gorse (1953) and Unknown Assailant (1955), which together comprise The Gorse Trilogy. If you enjoyed Hangover Square, you might like Norman Collins&#39;s London Belongs to Me, also available in Penguin Modern Classics. &#39;One of the great books of the twentieth century&#39; Independent on Sunday &#39;A masterly novel ... you can almost smell the gin&#39; Keith Waterhouse, Spectator</p><p>Patrick Hamilton was one of the most gifted and admired writers of his generation. Born in Hassocks, Sussex, in 1904, he and his parents moved a short while later to Hove, where he spent his early years. He published his first novel, Craven House, in 1926 and within a few years had established a wide readership for himself. Despite personal setbacks and an increasing problem with drink, he was able to write some of his best work. His plays include the thrillers Rope (1929), on which Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s film of the same name was based, and Gas Light (1939), also successfully adapted for the screen (1939), and a historical drama, The Duke in Darkness (1943). Among his novels are The Midnight Bell (1929); The Siege of Pleasure (1932); The Plains of Cement (1934); a trilogy entitled Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky (1935); Hangover Square (1941); The Slaves of Solitude (1947); and The West Pier (1951), Mr Stimpson and Mr Gorse (1953) and Unknown Assailant (1955), which together comprise The Gorse Trilogy. J. B. Priestley described Patrick Hamilton as uniquely individual ... He is the novelist of innocence, appallingly vulnerable, and of malevolence, coming out of some mysterious darkness of evil.&#39; Patrick Hamilton died in 1962.</p><h2>Christianity and Evolution</h2><p>Nineteen essays concerned with the relationship of science and religion.

Throughout her career, Mann has fearlessly pushed her exploration of the human form, tackling often difficult subject matter and making unapologetically sensual images that are simultaneously bold and lyrical. This beautifully produced publication includes Mann's earliest platinum prints from the late 1970s, Polaroid still lifes, early color work of her children, haunting landscape images, recent self-portraits and nude studies of her husband. These series document Mann's interest in the body as principal subject, with the associated issues of vulnerability and mortality lending an elegiac note to her images. In bringing them together, author and curator John Ravenal examines the varied ways in which Mann's experimental approach, including ambrotypes and gelatin-silver prints made from collodian wet-plate negatives, moves her subjects from the corporeal to the ethereal. Ravenal also supplies a comprehensive introduction as well as individual entries on each series, and essays by David Levi Strauss ("Eros, Psyche, and the Mendacity of Photography") and Anne Wilkes Tucker ("Living Memory") add different, but equally illuminating perspectives to this work. <i>Sally Mann: The Flesh and The Spirit </i>is a must for any serious library of photographic literature, students, scholars, collectors and others interested in her work.<br><b>Sally Mann</b> (born 1951) is one of America's most renowned photographers.

Placed in the larger context of contemporary attitudes toward ageing, illness, death and innocence her images tug at deep-seated contradictions we do not wish to acknowledge. Her gift is that she imbues them with a beauty that knocks the wind from your belly." --The Telegraph, Lucy Davies, 25-Nov-10<br><br>"The work is more like a series of question marks as Mann interrogates the perpetual failure of photographic representation in its quest for literal truths.

Throughout modern history, whenever one power threatened to establish a dominant position on the Continent, a coalition of states, great and small, was formed to oppose the threat. The most frequent coalitionist was Britain, whose navy ruled the seas but whose land forces were never of a size to challenge their Continental rivals. British-inspired alliances emerged in the War of the Spanish Succession against Louis XIV, in the wars against revolutionary France, and in the two world wars. In the twentieth century, they brought in the USA, whose impact on Europe rose from the peripheral to the decisive. Yet they all had one feature in common. They all sought to include at least one partner in the East. According to circumstances, that partner could be Prussia, Russia, or even Turkey. In the exceptional circumstances of 1939, it turned out to be a country which, though possessed of ancient credentials, had played little part in European power games for nearly three hundred years.</p><p></p><p>The Allied cause of the Second World War is invariably described in the simplest of terms. If ever there was a just war, one hears, this was it. The enemy was wicked. The goal of defeating that wickedness was noble. And the Allies were victorious. Most people, certainly in Britain and America, would not think that there was much more to be said. Of course, they are aware that the conduct of the war took many twists and turns. Those who have studied it know that the Allies stared defeat in the face on several occasions before victory was finally assured. But on the basic political and moral framework they harbour no misgivings. Few would contest the popular image of the wartime Allies as a band of brothers who fought for freedom and justice and saved the world from tyranny.</p><p>Several basic facts about the Allied cause, therefore, need to be emphasized from the outset. Firstly, membership of the Allied coalition was in constant flux. The band of brothers who set out to defy the Nazi threat in 1939, when the war is generally judged to have started, was not the same as that whose victory brought the war to a close six years later. Several important states changed sides in midstream; and the most powerful of the Allies stayed aloof almost until the mid-point of the conflict. Secondly, the Allied coalition contained all manner of member states, from global empires to totalitarian dictatorships, semi-constitutional monarchies, democratic republics, Governments-in-Exile, and several countries divided by civil war. Thirdly, when the fighting spread in December 1941 to the Pacific, the original war in Europe was complicated by numerous forms of interaction with the Asian theatre. In theory, the Allied cause came to be based on the undertakings of the United Nations Declaration of 1942, which obtained twenty-six signatories. The Declaration in turn was based on the terms of the earlier Atlantic Charter which, among other things, condemned territorial aggrandizement and confirmed 'the right of all peoples to choose their Governments'. In practice, the Allies were united by little except the commitment to fight the common enemy.</p><p>Throughout the war, the Alliance was clouded by the old-fashioned and highly paternalistic assumption that 'the principal Allies' were entitled to determine policy separately and in private, whilst 'the lesser Allies' were expected to accept the decisions of their betters. The assumption was not widely challenged at the time, and has rarely been challenged since by historians. But it was to have some serious consequences. Though never formally recognized, it was embodied in the workings of the 'Big Three' to which Winston Churchill, in conscious imitation of the experience of his eighteenth-century ancestor the Duke of Marlborough, gave the grand title of 'the Grand Alliance'.</p><p>The Allied cause was further complicated by the fact that most of its constituent members were caught up in their own tangled web of bilateral treaties, separate declarations, and subordinate alliances. All the 'United Nations', as they came to call themselves, were committed to cooperate in the struggle against the Axis powers. But they were not necessarily committed to defend or to assist each other. In particular, no mechanism was ever put in place to protect one ally from the depredations of another. Inter-Allied disputes that could not be readily resolved were usually deferred either to the intended post-war Peace Conference, which never happened, or to the United Nations Organisation, which did not open for business until September 1945.</p><p>On close examination, therefore, one can see that the ties binding different members of the coalition together differed widely in their nature and in their degree of commitment. The relations between Britain and the United States, for example, were largely conducted on the basis of mutual trust. With the sole exception of the Lend-Lease Agreement (February 1942), there was no formal or comprehensive British-US Treaty. British relations with France still operated on the rather imprecise understandings of the old Entente Cordiale. British relations with the USSR, in contrast, were governed by the elaborate provisions of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty signed on 12 July 1941. Soviet-American relations were similarly regulated by an agreement signed the following year. Generally speaking, the Western Allies saw diplomatic treaties as a constraining influence that limited the otherwise boundless scope for initiatives. The Soviet Union looked at them from the opposite perspective. They saw treaties with Western capitalist powers as vehicles of convenience, which enabled them to practise cooperation on a temporary and precisely defined basis, but not to modify their essentially hostile and suspicious stance.</p><p>The make-up and predispositions of the Allied coalition of 1939-45 were strongly influenced by its predecessor of 1914-18. During the First World War, France, Britain, Russia, and the USA had dominated the group of 'Entente Powers' which had challenged German hegemony. During the Second World War, the legacy of the Entente coloured the natural sympathies and alignments of the next Allied generation. Germany was taken to be a unique, unparalleled threat. France, Britain, and America imagined themselves to be paragons of democracy. The solidarity of the English-speaking world, re-established in 1917, was to be further strengthened. The Russians - as the Soviets were wrongly called - would be readily accepted as natural partners for the West, even though the old liberalizing regime of late tsardom had been replaced by a new totalitarian monster of far more sinister proclivities.</p><p>The men who rose to leadership in 1939-45 possessed a mental map of the world which had been formed thirty, forty, or even fifty years before. Churchill, for instance, born in 1874, was a Victorian who was well into adult life before the twentieth century arrived. Politics for him was the business of empires and of a hierarchy of states where clients and colonials could not aspire to equal treatment. Stalin was only five years younger, Roosevelt eight. All of them were older than Hitler or Mussolini. Almost all the top brass of the Allied military - Weygand, de Gaulle, Brooke, Montgomery, Zhukov, Rokossovsky, Patton, but <i>not</i> Eisenhower - had survived a formative experience in the First World War. They had been left not only with a searing memory of total war between massed armies but also of a particular vision of the map of Europe. They had grown up to believe that if the layout of Western Europe was rather complicated, that of Eastern Europe was rather straightforward. They knew Germany's place on the map from the Rhine to the Niemen. They knew that to the west of Germany lay a clutch of countries: Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Switzerland. But they thought that to the east of Germany there was nothing, or at least nothing of importance, except 'Russia'. After all, in the world of their youth, the German and the Russian Empires had been contiguous. Warsaw, like Riga or Vilno, had been a Russian city.</p><p>A true story nicely illustrates the mental maps that floated around in Western heads. One day in 1944 Gen. Montgomery met the commanding officer of the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division in Normandy for the first time. Looking for something to say, Montgomery asked him, 'Tell me, General, in Warsaw these days, do people speak Russian or German?' It was a blunder of capital proportions, equivalent to asking whether French or Latin is the language of London. But it should not cause too much surprise. After all, when Montgomery was a young soldier, Warsaw was in Russia. He would also have known that the Germans had captured Warsaw in 1915 and had done so again in 1939. What was more natural than to think of Warsaw as a place contested by Russians and Germans? It would have been a very rare and erudite Westerner who knew that Poland had a longer independent history than Russia and traditions of freedom and democracy that were older than Britain's.</p><p>For Western views of the nations of Eastern Europe, where they existed at all, often possessed a decidedly judgemental character. Winston Churchill, for example, divided the states of Europe unkindly into 'giants' and 'pygmies'. The giants were the Great Powers who had just fought the Great War. The pygmies were all those troublesome national states which had emerged through the collapse of the old empires and which had promptly started to fight each other. The dismissive approach to the New Europe was thinly disguised. And it was accompanied by a tendency to classify the pygmies as one might classify children, into the nice and the naughty. Europe's new nations were pictured as nice in Allied eyes if, like the Czechs and the Slovaks, they had won their independence by fighting against Germany or Austria. If, like the Ukrainians or the Irish, they had gained it by rebelling against an Allied power, they were naughty, not to say downright nasty. In the case of Ukraine, which had carved out its own republic with German help, it was taken to be a fiction. States which had not obtained Allied recognition did not really exist.</p><p>As for the Poles, who had dared to assert themselves both against the Central Powers and against Russia, they could be nothing other than mixed-up problem children. They were pygmies pretending to be giants. Some Polish leaders, who had spent the Great War in St Petersburg, London, or Paris, were obviously sound enough. But others, like Marshal Pilsudski, who spent years in the Austrian ranks fighting against the Russians, were clearly unreliable. The fact that Pilsudski had spent the last year of the war imprisoned in Magdeburg, having refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the Kaiser, did not remove the suspicion that he was dangerously 'pro-German'. The Marshal was dead by 1939. But the alleged ambivalence of his legacy lingered on. After all, in 1920, he had defied good sense by defeating Soviet Russia in battle, and in the 1930s he had signed non-aggression pacts with both Stalin and Hitler. His doctrine of 'two enemies' was thought very eccentric. By Allied standards, it was hard to see what the Poles were playing at.</p><p>The Allied camp evolved in several distinct stages. To begin with, in 1939, it consisted of just three states - France, the United Kingdom, and Poland. It did not include either Lithuania, whose port of Klajpeda (Memel) was seized by Germany on 23 March 1939, or Albania, which had been invaded and annexed by fascist Italy in April 1939, or indeed Finland, which was attacked by the Soviet Union in November. For Lithuania was coerced by Germany into the formal acceptance of its loss. The Italian annexation of Albania was recognized by France and Britain in a dubious diplomatic manoeuvre reminiscent of the recent Munich Agreement. And the Finno-Soviet conflict was brought to an uneasy close before any other states intervened. By Allied calculations, therefore, no significant breach of the peace occurred in Europe in 1939 other than the German assault on Poland in September. It was the Polish Crisis which brought the Allied coalition into being and gave it its first war aim. Poland had been allied to France since 1921, and to Britain by the Treaty of Mutual Assistance signed on 25 August 1939. Both France and Britain had publicly guaranteed Poland's independence on 31 March. So when the Wehrmacht poured over the Polish frontier at dawn on 1 September, the Allies possessed a clear <i>casus belli</i>.</p><p>After the fall of Poland in 1939 and the fall of France in 1940, the Allied camp is often said to have been reduced to the grand total of one, namely Britain. This is hardly correct even if one discounts the great support of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, the involvement of India, and the growing band of exiled Governments, some of them with significant military contingents at their disposal. For the United States was not exactly neutral. Whilst officially pursuing a policy of non-belligerency, President Roosevelt embarked on a systematic programme of turning his country into 'the great arsenal of democracy'. Energetic efforts were made to strengthen America's military establishment, to expand industrial production, and to lay down a 'two-ocean navy'. Huge supplies and subsidies were shipped to Britain under the principle of Lend-Lease. Both the Destroyers for Bases deal and the Atlantic Charter were in place well before the USA itself took to arms.</p><p>1941 saw the Allied coalition transformed by three capital events. On 22 June, Nazi Germany invaded the USSR, thereby changing Stalin from Hitler's friend to Hitler's mortal foe. On 7 December, Japan bombed the US Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor, thereby destroying American isolationism at one blow. Four days later, in a gesture of encouragement to its Japanese partner, Germany declared war on the USA. From then on, 'the Grand Alliance' was in place.</p><p>In the last phase of the war, as victory drew ever closer, any number of countries from Iraq to Liberia joined the Allied ranks. Former German allies such as Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland were forced to change sides. Former neutrals such as Turkey abandoned their neutrality. Finally, on 1 March 1945, Saudi Arabia boldly declared war on both Germany and Japan.</p><p>Britain's role in this changing constellation was absolutely crucial, though not necessarily in the ways that many Britons imagined. Britain did not 'win the war'. But it did fight on the winning side and it supplied the third largest group of military forces within the Allied camp. Above all, it supplied the main strand of continuity in the Allied cause. It was the only one of the Allied principals to wage war against Germany almost from the start and right to the end.</p></p><h2>Audrey&#39;s Door</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Sarah Langan is an audaciously terrifying storyteller, and <i>Audrey&#x2019;s Door</i> practically hums with frantic energy and hair-raising tension.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Tess Gerritsen </p><p><br><i>Rosemary&#x2019;s Baby</i> meets <i>The Shining </i>behind <i>Audrey&#x2019;s Door</i>&#x2014;a masterwork of psychological suspense and supernatural terror from the acclaimed author of <i>The Keeper </i>and<i> The Missing. </i>Ramsey Campbell, Matthew Pearl, and David Morrell are among the ever-growing legion of fans of this Bram Stoker Award-winning writer who Peter Straub says, &#x201c;combines a genuinely poetic sensibility with a taste for horror&#x2019;s most bravura excesses.&#x201d; Reviewers across the country have already compared Sarah Langan to H.P.

It was during this time that the great pyramids of Giza, the only remaining wonders of the ancient world, were built. When Greek historian Herodotus saw these monuments in the fifth century B.C.E., he was told they were constructed by the pharaohs Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure. Ironically, today, 170 years after their hieroglyphics were deciphered and extensive archaeological research has been conducted, we do not know much more than Herodotus did about this magnificent era of Egyptian art.<br> During the Old Kingdom, artists worked in an array of mediums and techniques, using wood, and precious metals to create monumental statues, reliefs, and wall paintings. Some four millennia later, these works of art maintain their power to move the viewer. "When the Pyramids Were Built: Egyptian Art of the Old Kingdom" is the catalogue that accompanies a landmark exhibition organized by The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Reunion des Musees Nationaux in Paris, and the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. The show brings together 115 Old Kingdom masterworks from museum collections throughout the world. <br> <br> Included in the exhibition, as well as this volume, are sculptures executed with such an acute observation of musculature and body movement that they brought an unprecedented realism to the rendering of men, women, children, and animals. Several depictions of family groups in particular show the sensitivity with which the Old Kingdom artists illuminated human relationships. Individual masterpieces include the monumental statue of Heminu, thought to be responsible for the construction of the Great Pyramid at Giza; groups representing the Fourth Dynasty king Menkaure with a queen and various deities; and a unique alabaster statuette showing Sixth Dynasty queen Ank-nes-meryre II holding her son, the child king Pepi II, in her lap.<br> <br> The lively text by Dorothea Arnold offers an overview of the history, society, and art of the Old Kingdom, and an informative discussion of each of the illustrated works. All of the pieces were newly photographed for this book by Bruce White.</p><p>The Egyptian Old Kingdom (c. 2650-2150 BC) was an era of extraordinary artistic achievement-the period that gave us the Sphinx and the pyramids as well as a rich legacy of private tombs, wall paintings, reliefs, statuary, jewelry, and decorative arts. This book, the companion volume to a major traveling exhibition organized by New York&#39;s Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Louvre in Paris, showcases the most impressive assemblage of Egyptian art and artifacts since the Tutankhamun exhibition of the late 1970s. Scholarly essays and 650 illustrations bring to life a remarkable panoply of Old Kingdom objects-temple and tomb reliefs, striking gold jewelry, handsome stone vessels, monumental statues, stelae, and exquisite statuettes.

By the author of E. M. Forster: A Life.</p><p>P.N. Furbank was born in Surrey in 1920 and has worked as an academic, in publishing and as a freelance writer and critic. In 1986 he was appointed Visiting Professor in Literature at the Open University.His publications include <i>Samuel Butler (1835-1902)</i>, <i>Italo Svevo: The Man and the Writer</i>, <i>Reflections on the Word 'Image'</i>, <i>E.M. Forster: A Life</i>, <i>Unholy Pleasure: The Idea of Social Class</i> and (with W.R. Owens) <i>The Canonisation of Daniel Defoe</i>."Truly, posterity would be an ungrateful wretch if it forgot me altogether," wrote Denis Diderot (1713-1784), "seeing how often I remember it."305 Diderot was not to be forgotten but rather misremembered, often as simply the cutler's son who for 20-plus years labored over that monument of the 18th century, the Encyclopedie. This account gives short shrift to a life that included a spell in prison, the writing of a pornographic novel, an eccentric family, a longtime love affair and a circle of celebrated friends, among them D'Alembert, Mme d'Epinay, Grimm and Rousseau. It also shortchanges the works that are uniquely Diderot's own. Furbank's ( E. M. Forster ) special strength is in illuminating Diderot's plays, philosophical writings, art criticism and fiction, lucidly following his struggle with two ideas--fiction as deception and fiction as illusion. Weaving together biography and criticism can distort a subject's chronology and can strain a writer's transitions and place undue demands on a reader, such as having to recall the dates of works each time they are mentioned. But works and life are unavoidably integral; as Marmontel notes, "He who knows Diderot only from his books does not know him at all." Furbank certainly does not fit into this category.

A tall, slender, hardworking family man with a penchant for bow ties, Wood (1913-1979) was born, lived and died in the Fort Worth, Texas area, and his photography played a central role in how his clients chose to see and to portray themselves and their city. <i>Bill Wood's Business</i> features approximately 300 of Wood's photographs, alongside essays by Diane Keaton and Marvin Heiferman that pay homage to the skills Wood (and professional photographers like him) brought to the business of photography. What drew Keaton and Heiferman to this project was the extraordinary range of Wood's images, as well as a shared appreciation of archives and the construction of photographic realities. In an earlier collaboration, <i>Still Life</i> (1982), Keaton and Heiferman explored the Surrealism, the fantasies and the economic motivations percolating beneath the surface of the glamourous color publicity photographs that Hollywood studios orchestrated and distributed in the mid-twentieth century. Since then, Keaton (in her film and book projects) and Heiferman (in his curatorial, writing and publishing work) have continued to survey the quirks of American iconography. Keaton purchased the archive of Wood's negatives 20 years ago, and in <i>Bill Wood's Business</i>, she and Heiferman team up again to look at and through photographs, to show what they are intended to depict and what they actually reveal.</p><p></p><h2>Dick Tracy&#39;s Fiendish Foes: A 60th Anniversary Celebration</h2><p>For six decades, some square-jawed flatfoot by the name of Richard Tracy has been mucking up perfectly good - often brilliant - careers in crime.

Soon, the reason is revealed: Toad Hall used to be the center of the community's festivities, but now the horrible Mrs. Ffleshe swoops in each year and ruins the holidays. Mole decides to launch a campaign to bring Christmas back to the River Bank. The ride is not smooth, of course, and before the happy ending, we see Toad fling himself into the river, Mole get caught by weasel hoodlums, and the most magnificent jailbreak in history. Quite appropriate for children as well as adults, this fourth sequel to Kenneth Grahame's <i>Wind in the Willows</i> is as delightful as its predecessors. The characters are well drawn, as the story perfectly demonstrates Mole's shy kindness, Toad's grandiosity, Ratty's resourcefulness, Otter's loyalty, and Badger's wisdom. With understated dialogue and endearing characters, this is a most pleasant celebration of the season. <i>Beth Warrell</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Hard pressed on two military fronts, and with America about to enter the war, Germany makes a deal with Lenin: money and secret transportation to Petrograd in exchange for his promise to pull Russia out of the conflict. Churchill gets wind of the scheme and, with the support of Secretary of State House (though without the knowledge of President Wilson), hires an American secret agent, the tough and resourceful Bauer, to kill Lenin on the journey. Bauer boards the train disguised as a member of Lenin's revolutionary party and, in circumstances that become increasingly perilous after his cover is blown and he has fallen for the charms of a beautiful "comrade," makes attempt after attempt to fulfill his assignment. Hyman (The Russian Woman, Giant Killer) doesn't quite display Forsyth's narrative flair, but his story is a clever mix of fact and fiction, and propulsively suspenseful. 35,000 first printing. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.In March 1917, the German government, desperate to remove Russia from the war, agrees to ship the revolutionary leader Lenin back to Russia in a closed railway car and to finance his efforts to overthrow the provisional government. It is the premise of this rather superficial novel that the English have commissioned Lenin's assassination before the train arrives in St. Petersburg. On the way, the assassin, American Harry Bauer, becomes involved emotionally with a beautiful revolutionary. Germans, Americans, Bolsheviks, and English pursue him as the scheme unwinds. Petrograd is a thriller that does not thrill. Its suspense is contrived, its characters and incidents shallow, its plot thin.

By the author of A Unit of Water, A Unit of Time. Original. 10,000 first printing.</p><p>Douglas Whynott is director of the MFA program at Emerson College.Whynott (Giant Bluefin) has been enamored with bees since he was a boy and his uncle kept a hive near an apple tree; later his passion led him to become a bee inspector in Massachusetts. From these experiences, and from research conducted by following his contacts&#x2014;the migratory beekeepers&#x2014;he has gathered a wealth of information on the fascinating habits of bees, the history of bee farming and the current state of beekeeping legislation. Whynott begins by explaining the discoveries, like &#x2018;bee space,&#x2019; that allowed for the development of migratory farming, which allows beekeepers to move apiaries from location to location in search of "bloom." Whynott then travels to the blueberry barrens in Maine to Florida, to North Dakota clover country and finally to Washington, D.C., where Glenn Gibson, a honey lobbyist, tries to gain federal support for the migratory beekeepers who comprise the lion&#x2019;s share of the honey market. With a relaxed, storyteller&#x2019;s pacing, Whynott gets to know the migratory beekeepers, and much of the book&#x2019;s pleasure lies in the colloquial dialogue about "plugged out" frames of honey and "bearded" hives. More than a book about bees per se, this volume presents a sociological narrative about truckers&#x2019; lives, and the (mostly) men who seem to fall by chance into beekeeping. This reprint of the 1991 edition includes a helpful glossary that explains bee terminology. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

[T]he perfect remedy for any summer that's been disappointingly short on thrills."<br><br>From School Library Journal:<br>Eleven-year-old Tom Hammond lives with his widowed mother in a windblown old house chained to the top of a gigantic rock. One night, unable to sleep, he heads down to the stream that borders their property, where he has left a heavy piece of refrigerator packing foam. What starts out as aimless drifting down quiet water turns deadly when Tom's foam slab feeds into the rougher mountain water and he is pulled under a rock, ending up in an underwater cavern. The secrets he discovers while attempting to find his way out of the mountain caves are surprising, yet seamlessly executed. Wilson's rich imagination and his quirky characters are a true delight. Tom's feisty mother will not believe that her son has drowned despite the evidence to the contrary, and her run-ins with various townspeople are jewels in themselves. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep both seasoned and reluctant readers turning the pages. Think Mark Twain with a contemporary and utterly captivating twist.<br><br>From Booklist:<br>Fleeing the possibility of a new stepfather, 11-year-old Tom Hammond washes downriver into a series of caves that contain&nbsp;a few&nbsp;dead bodies; Reg, a man who has been&nbsp;trapped inside for three years; mysterious carvings; and no apparent way out. Outside, on their mountaintop, his grieving mother, threatened by treasure hunters, continues to search for him. Tom's adventures have several literary ancestors, including&nbsp;Tom and Huck in the cave, and&nbsp;the inventive&nbsp;Swiss Family Robinson, but&nbsp;this&nbsp;is solidly set in the present, standing on its own with well-crafted suspense and fascinating survival detail. Underlying the story is the possibility that explorers from ancient civilizations arrived in North America long before Columbus, a theory certain to interest middle-grade readers. They will also relish the physicality of the&nbsp;journey: underwater swims, tight passages, and rock climbing as Tom, Reg, and a found dog search for an exit. A crotchety neighbor and a group of local thugs add to the tension of this appealing and easy-to-booktalk package.<br><br>From The Horn Book Magazine:<br>Wilson sets the scene vividly, from Tom's home to the labyrinth of tunnels and caverns under the mountain, and the central characters' emotional lives develop both naturally and affectingly. [Readers] will appreciate both the fast-paced adventure and Tom's determination to make the impossible journey back home.<br><br>From Kirkus Reviews:<br>Eleven-year-old Tom Hammond is not happy with his mother's choice of a possible future fiance; Mr. Veatch is not only a teacher, but he's pretty gross. One night, Tom just wants to get away from the house and his mother for awhile, but he ends up stuck in an underground cave with a dead man and an injured dog. Using the dead man's headlamp, Tom looks for a way out and ends up finding history, personal and national. Meanwhile, Elizabeth, his mother, is certain her son is alive. She tries to get help, but the only people willing to "help" are unscrupulous treasure seekers. Tom not only escapes the caves with the dog and a new friend, he also helps to save his mother from Mr. Veatch and the treasure hunters. Wilson's debut is a literate, sometimes humorous page-turner in the classic tradition. Well-read adventure lovers are in for a treat looking for echoes of The Odyssey and Tom Sawyer.This is a strong choice for every type of library.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Creative Way to Paint</h2><p>A description of an original but systematic approach to expressing feelings artistically</p><p></p><h2>Las Soldaderas: Women of the Mexican Revolution</h2><p><p><br>The photographs of <i>Las Soldaderas</i> and Elena Poniatowska&#x2019;s remarkable commentary rescue the women of the Mexican Revolution from the dust and oblivion of history. These are the Adelitas and Valentinas celebrated in famous <i>corridos mexicanos,</i> but whose destiny was much more profound and tragic than the idealistic words of ballads. The photographs remind Poniatowska of the trail of women warriors that begins with the Spanish conquest and continues to Mexico&#x2019;s violent revolution. These women are valiant, furious, loyal, maternal, and hardworking; they wear a mask that is part immaculate virgin, part mother and wife, and part savage warrior; and they are joined together in the cruel hymn of blood and death from which they built their own history of the Revolution.</p><p><br>The photographs are culled from the vast Casasola Collection in the Fototeca Nacional of the National Institute of Anthropology and History in Pachuca, Hidalgo, Mexico.</p></p><p>Elena Poniatowska is writer, renowned journalist, and professor. Her journalism and writing explore and grapple with events; in addition, she is a biographer and translator, and the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including a Guggenheim Fellowship and an Emeritus Fellowship from Mexico&#39;s National Council of Culture and Arts.<br>"Mexico's revolutionary women soldiers have been all but excised from history. Poniatowska resurrects their astonishing stories, while striking photographs culled from the vast archive created by Agustin Casasola, whose complete oeuvre is showcased in <i>Mexico: The Revolution and Beyond</i> (2003), preserve the soldaderas' dignity, strength, and beauty, creating a unique and welcoming volume that reclaims women of valor with grace and precision." &#x2014;<b>Booklist</b><br><br>"[Poniatowska] developed a form of writing, blending personal histories and fiction into what is known as a testimonial novel. This oversized book is a picturesque story of the women who followed, and at times, fought and died alongside their men, in battles that began with the Spanish Conquest and continued to the end of Mexico's violent revolution." &#x2014;<b>Polish American Journal</b><br><br>"The ferocity of <i>Soldaderas</i>' imagery is undeniable." &#x2014;<b> The Austin Chronicle</b><br><br>"<i>Las Soldaderas</i> serves its main purpose: to serve as a platform for the women of the Mexican Revolution. More than a staid, academic history book, Las Soldaderas is a collection of stories that reflect the submission, valor, devotion the brav�a of the daughters of M�xico." &#x2014;<b>Southwestern American Literature</b><br><br>"Poniatowska quotes from both history books and novels to portray a group of women who were essential to the 20th century's first revolution. 'Without the soldaderas, there is no Mexican Revolution they kept it alive and fertile, like the earth,' she writes. The book is a short history, but the photographs speak louder than any chapters." &#x2014;<b>The Monitor</b><br><br>"This English translation by David Romo is an eye-opening book about the many various roles of women during the revolution...The photographs are superb and reproduced on high quality paper that brings them to life. Highly recommended for public and academic libraries."&#x2014;<b>Reforma</b><br><br>"Poniatowska offers anecdotes to help us know these women, sometimes using their own words. Pancho Villa does not fair well here, nor do other men who took brutal advantage of -- or even murdered -- these women. Las Soldaderas perfectly weds words with photographs as a poignant tribute to the brave women who were active participants in the Mexican Revolution."&#x2014;<b>El Paso Times</b><br><br>"[Poniatowska's] narrative of the amazing contributions and tribulations of these valiant women really give you the feel of what it was like to march hungry, search a battlefield for your man, to really suffer as they did, and to be fierce and indomitable. I stand amazed at how much they did, how strong they were, and how little they were valued by most people...You need this book. The Soldaderas need you to know them." &#x2014;<b>BlogCritics Magazine</b><br><br>"Of the many versions describing an event, it is collectively that we may paint a more complete picture. Only then do we get a better glimpse of what history is truly about. <i>Las Soldaderas Women of the Mexican Revolution</i> is a good read, if not for the vintage photographs, then for the dual experience of reading and looking at a history of social change."&#x2014;<b>El Paso Magazine</b><br><br>"There are almost fifty photographs from 1910 - 1920 reproduced here.

Apparently everyone except teamsters, riverboat operators, and Native Americans agreed that a transcontinental railroad was a good idea, but sorting out the politics of its route and financing (plus the burden of a civil war) took five times as long as its actual construction. Blumberg introduces the main players, from Leland Stanford and other ruthless capitalists to the visionary engineers and tough foremen--especially Theodore Judah, Grenville Dodge and James Strobridge--who saw the work through; she pays tribute to the thousands of Chinese immigrants who carved a path through the Sierra Nevadas, paints a vivid picture of the wild life in Laramie and other railroad towns, and brings the story to a conclusion with the famous meeting at Promontory Summit, Utah (not miles-distant Promontory Point, as many accounts have it), where ceremonies ``neither dignified nor inspirational'' nonetheless touched off a national celebration. A generous selection of contemporary black-and-white photographs and enlarged engravings capture the rowdy town and work-camp life while underscoring the sheer number of people involved in the enterprise. Since Blumberg touches only on the specifics of railroad construction, working conditions, various financial scandals, and railroad lore and legend, pair this with Leonard Everett Fisher's Tracks Across America (1992) for a more complete picture. (map, notes, bibliography, index) (Nonfiction. 11-14) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Newbery Honor author Blumberg (Commodore Perry in the Land of the Shogun) offers not only an assiduously documented, spikes-and-bolts chronicle of the "great race" to create the first cross-country railroad by laying track between Sacramento and Omaha, but an absorbing panorama of the project's dramatic effect on the American frontier. Lacing her narrative with often amusing anecdotes and ample quotes, Blumberg spins a tale thick with intrigue and controversy. Feuding began almost immediately as congressmen argued about whether the track should be laid on Northern or Southern soil, thus stalling the project until President Lincoln signed the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862. Many memorable personalities emerge here, including the visionaries who conceived of transcontinental rail travel in the 1850s; the greedy, profiteering businessmen who organized the Central Pacific Railroad Company, charged with building the railroad eastward from California; and the stalwart laborers, many of them Chinese, Native American and Mormon, who endured bitter mountain blizzards, sweltering desert heat and, sometimes, extreme prejudice. Attractively designed, the volume contains numerous period illustrations and on-site photos of the mammoth undertaking.

Deals with a particularly exciting period in mid-evil history; Northwest Europe at about 1240. This is the time when the experience of the crusades was breaking up the old social order; when towns were growing and nations developing. The crusaders had brought back revolutionary new ideas about warfare; castle building; and chivalry; and the knightly class was still a power -- though this would change soon It is a time which gave rise to some of our best ideas and most stirring stories.</p><p></p><h2>The Auditorium Building: A Building Book from the Chicago Architecture Foundation, No. A687</h2><p>Commissioned by Ferdinand Peck and produced by architects Louis Sullivan and Dankmar Adler--soon to be leaders of the Chicago School--in 1889, the Auditorium Building was a wondrous complex, housing a hotel, offices, stores, and a theater. Adler's engineering skills overcame the problem of a foundation that had to support an unevenly distributed weight; Sullivan designed the stunning theater, which was spanned by four elliptical arches studded with 3,500 incandescent electric lights and decorated with gold leaf. Adler created a hydraulic stage--with twenty-six lifts--and one of the first air-conditioning systems in a public building. <p>Among the many design features in the interior of the Auditorium were murals, onyx, marble, open loggias, stained glass, filigreed vents, wainscoting, and bronze-plated posts. Scholars considered the Auditorium Building the most important single structure in Chicago.</p></p><p></p><h2>Shadow Work: The Unpaid, Unseen Jobs That Fill Your Day</h2><p>With the exception of sleep, humans spend more of their lifetimes on work than any other activity. It is central to our economy, society, and the family. It underpins our finances and our sense of meaning in life. Given the overriding importance of work, we need to recognize a profound transformation in the nature of work that is significantly altering lives: the incoming tidal wave of shadow work.<br><br>Shadow work includes all the unpaid tasks we do on behalf of businesses and organizations. It has slipped into our routines stealthily; most of us do not realize how much of it we are already doing, even as we pump our own gas, scan and bag our own groceries, execute our own stock trades, and build our own unassembled furniture. But its presence is unmistakable, and its effects far-reaching.<br><br>Fueled by the twin forces of technology and skyrocketing personnel costs, shadow work has taken a foothold in our society. Lambert terms its prevalence as middle-class serfdom,&#x201d; and examines its sources in the invasion of robotics, the democratization of expertise, and new demands on individuals at all levels of society. The end result? A more personalized form of consumption, a great social leveling (pedigrees don&#x2019;t help with shadow work!), and the weakening of communities as robotics reduce daily human interaction.<br><br><i>Shadow Work</i> offers a field guide to this new phenomenon. It shines a light on these trends now so prevalent in our daily lives and, more importantly, offers valuable insight into how to counter their effects. It will be essential reading to anyone seeking to understand how their day got so full and how to deal with the ubiquitous shadow work that surrounds them.<br></p><p><b>Craig Lambert</b> is the author of <i>Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life from the Art of Rowing</i>.

Being able to do one or two things for yourself can feel liberating; having to do everything can make you feel like a slave to the machine.&#x201d; <i>The Economist</i><br><br>"You doubtless feel too busy to read yet more about why we all feel so busy, but here&#x2019;s a short book to put on your long to-do list. Even if you have time only to skim it, you&#x2019;ll see your lack of leisure in a fresh light....[B]efore you can hope to rebalance your time, you&#x2019;d better first understand how you actually spend it." <i>The Atlantic</i><br><br> he gives so many outstanding examples from all facets of life that, as you read through each of the chapters, you will have enough data to notice exactly how you are spending your time and whether you would choose to keep spending it that way or to do something else.<br>Overall, I feel that Shadow Work&#x2019; is a fantastic book for those who feel time slipping away and want to get the best use of the time they have.&#x201d; <i>Small Business Trends</i><br><br> With wry wit and interesting tales of this tectonic (or should we say techtonic) shift, Lambert laments the loss of human connection this screen-gazing entails the time wasted, the expertise compromised and the money unearned by both shadow workers and would-be employees.&#x201d; <i>The Improper Bostonian</i><br><br> Lambert&#x2019;s guide to this phenomenon explains how the modern American&#x2019;s day has gotten so full, offering some unique insights into the ubiquitous tasks that lengthen the work day and creep into downtime.&#x201d; <i>Library Journal</i><br><br> An appealingly different view of employment based on what people actually do and not just statistics.&#x201d; <i>Kirkus</i><br><br> By exposing this phenomenon, Lambert may help readers become more aware of their choices and opportunities.

Craig Lambert's important book will change how you think about your days. <i>Shadow work</i> is a new and vitally important concept for understanding the new economy.

Summers, Former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Professor and President Emeritus, Harvard University.<br><br> With precision, wit, and erudition, Craig Lambert identifies the invisible drains on our leisure time and on our mental and emotional freedoms. None of us signed up for all of this pro bono overtime for corporations. How can we quit? This book shows the problem's economic and social causes and even better, suggests an escape route.&#x201d; Virginia Heffernan, author, <i>Magic and Loss: The Pleasures of the Internet</i><br><br> Without any debate or conscious choice, during the last couple of decades technology has radically changed the premises and nature of everyday life and work. We may know this, more or less, but reading Shadow Work still triggers multiple "D'oh!" moments. Craig Lambert lucidly, thoughtfully, and provocatively connects the dots of this profound, pervasive, and unfinished social and economic transformation.&#x201d; Kurt Andersen, author of <i>True Believers</i> and host, Studio 360<br><br> Who knows what larceny lurks in the heart of our economy? Lambert knows.&#x201d; Roy Blount Jr., author of <i>Alphabet Juice</i><br><br> Where have all the sales clerks/bank tellers/travel agents gone? Long time passing, along with the secretaries, waitstaff, ticket agents, and so many more. Those jobs still exist, but now you, the so-called customer, are doing them without pay, of course, and on your own time. As Craig Lambert shows in this mordant, mischievous book, our no-service gig economy gives new meaning to the phrase "free market." Hendrik Hertzberg, Staff writer, <i>The New Yorker</i><br><br> Think you know how you spend your days? Think again. <i>Shadow Work</i> is a visionary book that will change the way you look at well, just about everything.&#x201d; Andy Borowitz,<i>The New Yorker</i><br><br> I've been enjoying Craig Lambert's work for decades in <i>Harvard Magazine</i>.

From the first page, he'll have you looking at your life, and the world, in a whole new way.&#x201d; Mike Reiss, Emmy-winning writer, <i>The Simpsons</i><br><br> Shadow work is all the things we do from assembling our own furniture to booking our own travel that has become the new normal. And like everything that becomes the new normal, it is invisible. Lambert's ambition is substantial: to make that invisible visible. His hope is that once we see where we are, we can make some choices about where we want to go. A deft writer; a compelling case.&#x201d; Sherry Turkle, Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology, MIT, and the author of <i>Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other</i><br><br> Craig Lambert combines his gifts as sociologist and detective to solve that perennial mystery: where has all our time gone? In <i>Shadow Work</i> he reveals how we unwittingly perform labors that companies used to do, but have offloaded onto us. Reading Shadow Work will be full of A-ha! moments for readers. It's delightful, surprising, witty, and smart.&#x201d; Daniel Goleman, author of <i>Emotional Intelligence</i><br><br> <i>Shadow Work</i> is an eye-opening expose of the countless subtle ways in which corporations and other large organizations are conscripting all of us to donate our invaluable time and labor to advance their economic and other goals, without our consent and often even without our awareness. By bringing this serious problem out of the shadows, this important book makes an essential contribution toward countering it.&#x201d; Nadine Strossen, John Marshall Harlan II Professor of Law, New York Law School and former President of the ACLU<br><br> This book will revolutionize the way you look at how you spend your time doing countless hours of unpaid work for The Man.

Its themes are distilled into tight, poetic summations; its autobiographical elements (including the portrait of Boston's Charles River rowing community) prove engaging; its feels-like-you're-there descriptions have an appealing immediacy; and the author's passion for rowing is conveyed convincingly.&#x201d; <i>Booklist</i></p><h2>When the Earth Nearly Died: Compelling Evidence of a World Cataclysm 11,500 Years Ago</h2><p>Carefully gathered evidence from many disciplines tell of a cataclysm which nearly destroyed Earth and Mars about 11,500 years ago.

Crustal shifting, the tilting of Earth's axis, mass extinctions, upthrusted mountain ranges, rising and shrinking land masses, and gigantic volcanic eruptions and earthquakes--all indicate that a fateful confrontation with a destructive cosmic visitor must have occurred.

As Dr. Peikoff subsequently explored the concept of induction, he sought out David Harriman, a physicist who had taught philosophy, for his expert knowledge of the scientific discovery process. <br><br> Here, Harriman presents the result of a collaboration between scientist and philosopher. Beginning with a detailed discussion of the role of mathematics and experimentation in validating generalizations in physics-looking closely at the reasoning of scientists such as Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Lavoisier, and Maxwell-Harriman skillfully argues that the inductive method used in philosophy is in principle indistinguishable from the method used in physics.</p><p><b>Leonard Peikoff</b> is universally recognized as the pre-eminent Rand scholar writing today.

The unlikely hero&#x2014;Basil, he is called&#x2014;cannot find a single creature like itself nor a person who can tell him what he is. But it is clear that Basil is much more than he seems when he stumbles into an encounter with the great Merlin, saving his child&#x2019;s life, then uncovers a secret plot by the evil Rhita Gawr. It&#x2019;s a race against time and across Avalon as Basil, with the help of the faithful wind sister Ailah, searches for the great wizard to warn him.<p> This is one of T.A. Barron&#x2019;s most thrilling adventures yet and features a new and unforgettable character in his earliest years.<br><br></p></p><p>T.A. Barron is the award-winning author of fantasy novels such as <i>The Lost Years of Merlin</i> epic&#x2014;soon to be a major motion picture. He serves on a variety of environmental and educational boards including The Nature Conservancy and The Land and Water Fund of the Rockies, and is the founder of a national award for heroic children. Following a life-changing decision to leave a successful business career to write full-time in 1990, Barron has written seventeen books, but is happiest when on the mountain trails with his wife, Currie, and their five children.<p> </p>Grade 6 Up&#x2014;Set between Barron's "Lost Years of Merlin" and "Great Tree of Avalon" series, this book focuses on Basil, a unique lizard that sets out to understand his identity and his destiny. While small, Basil has a magical ability to create smells, and he uses his talent and his wits to escape a number of foes. After a series of encounters with the wizard Merlin, including attending his wedding, Basil learns from the good spirit Dagda that the evil spirit Rhita Gawr has entered the lands of Avalon and that Merlin is in grave danger. With the wind sister Aylah, he travels to all seven realms, learning about each one and about himself in his quest to save Merlin and all of Avalon from the magic-devouring kreelix. While this adventure starts out slowly and spans almost 40 years, the pace picks up rapidly during the second half. Basil is a prickly and entertaining hero, and his comments about life at the start of each chapter add tone and humor. Barron's return to Avalon will be welcomed by his many fans, who will have the patience to explore the lands with Basil and learn more about their history.&#x2014;<i>Beth L.

This century&#39;s great renewal is examined through the eyes of Henri de Lubac, who reintroduced the idea of the Church herself as the great Sacrament &#39;which contains and vitalises all the others&#39;. This is an understanding profoundly traditional but at the same time capable of generating consequences of extraordinary power and originality. The book makes significant contributions to contemporary thinking on ecumenism, evangelisation and ecology. Concern for unity with other churches arises from the recognition of a common Christian mission to the whole of humanity - and furthermore to all creation. How the ecumenical movement has reflected upon the Church is examined here, in connection with major ecumenical statements on the Eucharist.Paul McPartlan is Carl J.

She lives in Denver, Colorado.K-Gr. 3. There are lots of humor and probably a little truth in this hilarious account of a new teacher's first year, which is relayed in a series of classroom letters. On September ninth, Shannon, who has noticed Mrs. Hartwell's hand shaking when she puts her name on the blackboard, writes to her teacher, "that's when I figured you might be a little scared, just like me." Missives in generic type are interspersed with handwritten letters from Josh, a student whose spelling and handwriting noticeably improve throughout the year. Especially funny are students' observations about the principal: "When Mrs. Burton came into our class today, your face turned really red. I peeked to see what she was writing. I couldn't read a word! Did you know Mrs. Burton has very messy handwriting?" The funny illustrations show the class in glorious chaos, from dealing with an escaped class pet snake to the disarray after knocking over of a stuffed bison during a field trip to a natural history museum. Kids and teachers alike will appreciate this unusual take on the ups and downs of a school year. <i>Diane Foote</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

My eyes drifted open halfway, just enough to register the sun streaming through the open blinds. Nathaniel&#x2019;s arm was thrown around my waist, his body snuggled into my back. The child inside my belly shifted under his hand. The scent of bacon cooking drifted from the kitchen.</p><p>My three dogs, Lock, Stock and Barrel, nosed inside the bedroom door, their nails clicking across the hardwood floor. They came around to my side of the bed, their doggy faces set in mute appeal, tongues lolling.</p><p>It seemed like a pretty typical domestic scene, except that there is nothing typical about my life. The dogs weren&#x2019;t dogs at all, but Retrievers&#x2014;powerful magical creatures who&#x2019;d given me their allegiance when I&#x2019;d freed them from slavery to the Agency.</p><p>The man in bed with me wasn&#x2019;t a man, but the son of an angel and a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, I wasn&#x2019;t sure exactly what Puck was, but he was definitely something old and powerful. Besides his lack of humanity, Nathaniel also wasn&#x2019;t the father of my child. He wasn&#x2019;t even my lover, or my boyfriend. I didn&#x2019;t know how to define our relationship status as any other way except &#x201c;complicated.&#x201d;</p><p>The person cooking the bacon in the kitchen was my many-greats-uncle Daharan, brother of Lucifer, dragon shapeshifter, creature of fire and something older than the Earth itself.</p><p>As for me, I was the daughter of a fallen angel and an Agent of Death. Lucifer was my grandfather. My baby had the blood of a half nephilim inside his veins, a legacy from his dead father. I had more enemies than I could count. I&#x2019;d spent the last several months trying to stay alive while those enemies tried to kill me and my very ancient family members plotted around me.</p><p>We were definitely not going to win any awards for normality in this family.</p><p>The dogs needed walking, but everyone pretended not to notice because no one could control them except me.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming, I&#x2019;m coming,&#x201d; I grumbled, sliding out from beneath Nathaniel&#x2019;s arm.</p><p>This was harder than it sounded. I was only three months pregnant, but it appeared that I was twice that. I&#x2019;d never fully appreciated the ease and elasticity with which I&#x2019;d rolled out of bed before I took on the aspect of a hippo.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you want me to come with you?&#x201d; Nathaniel murmured.</p><p>&#x201c;No one is going to mess with me while I&#x2019;m walking these three,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Besides, it&#x2019;s been a quiet couple of weeks.&#x201d;</p><p>And it had been, I reflected as I got dressed. Since I&#x2019;d killed Titania, the faerie queen. Since Nathaniel&#x2019;s half brother&#x2014;and heir to the court of Titania and Oberon&#x2014;Bendith had been killed by his biological father, Puck. Since Puck had tricked me into freeing him from his bondage to Titania.</p><p>Since I&#x2019;d had an adventure in another space and time, and discovered the darker places in my heart, the black menace at the core of my magic. I&#x2019;d worked hard to force that darkness to recede, to let my natural personality reassert itself. But it seemed that since I&#x2019;d tapped into that power, it floated closer to the surface, shadows seeping into my edges.</p><p>Like so many things that I&#x2019;d discovered since becoming aware of my ancestry, my new magical abilities were impossible to undo. And my darling grandfather Lucifer definitely preferred it that way. <i>All the better to tempt you with, my dear.</i></p><p>Lucifer cherished a long-held hope that I would give up my life and become heir to his kingdom. I&#x2019;d rather eat nails for breakfast than manacle myself to the first of the fallen. Besides, Lucifer&#x2019;s crazy lover Evangeline was pregnant with his child, and I knew very well that she was angling to put that kid on the throne. If I expressed even the smallest iota of interest in taking Lucifer&#x2019;s offer, she would set a thousand assassins upon me, regardless of what Lucifer might want.</p><p>No, embroiling myself further in Lucifer&#x2019;s machinations was definitely not at the top of my to-do list. I pulled on a pair of jeans I couldn&#x2019;t button. The taut roundness of my lower belly protruded over the fly. I pushed a rubber band through the buttonhole, looped it and wrapped the other end around the button to keep the pants from sliding down. A long, baggy Cubs sweatshirt completed this uber-stylish look. I shoved my slippers on and padded out of the room.</p><p>In the kitchen, my uncle Daharan was making pancakes and bacon in large quantities and placing them on covered platters I didn&#x2019;t even know I owned. He&#x2019;s not your garden-variety uncle. He&#x2019;s an ancient being, one of Lucifer&#x2019;s three brothers, and he spends at least part of his time in dragon form.</p><p>For the moment he was living in the apartment downstairs. Locks didn&#x2019;t keep him out, and he came and went freely between my place and his. Somehow I couldn&#x2019;t be irritated about this. There was some quality about Daharan that made me trust him, trust that he would do me no harm. Beezle wasn&#x2019;t so sure, as he tended not to trust anyone so closely related to Lucifer, but as I entered the kitchen I noticed his mistrust of Daharan did not extend to disdain of his cooking. Beezle was perched on the counter next to the platters filching as much bacon as he could while Daharan&#x2019;s back was turned.</p><p>The dogs trotted ahead of me, down the hall, and stopped before the front door while I paused in the kitchen.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a whole lot of breakfast for three people and a gargoyle,&#x201d; I remarked.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re eating for two,&#x201d; Beezle said before Daharan could answer.</p><p>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re eating for five,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Daharan ignored the byplay. &#x201c;We will be having guests this morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What guests?&#x201d; I asked warily. The last thing I wanted was for one of Daharan&#x2019;s brothers to show up. Alerian terrified me. Lucifer infuriated me.</p><p>And Puck&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, when I thought of the way Puck had manipulated me into destroying one of the oldest creatures in the universe for his own personal gain, those shadows on my heart threatened to overtake me. I truly thought I could beat Puck bloody with a crowbar and it wouldn&#x2019;t bother me in the least. Of course, when I had thoughts like that I knew that the darkness was spreading inside me like a cancer. I wasn&#x2019;t sure if there was anything I could do to stop it.</p><p>&#x201c;You will see when they arrive,&#x201d; Daharan said.</p><p>I&#x2019;d almost forgotten I&#x2019;d asked a question, so caught up was I in thoughts of vengeance on Puck.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you invite someone?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Daharan said mildly, but with a finality that let me know he wasn&#x2019;t going to tell me anything more.</p><p>Lucifer and all of his brothers could see aspects of the future. Daharan was able to see with the most clarity. So someone was coming. Someone whose arrival Daharan had foreseen, but he didn&#x2019;t want to share with me for some reason.</p><p>I shrugged and went to the waiting dogs, who panted in anticipation. As soon as I opened the front door they crowded out in a rush, jumping all over one another in their eagerness to leave. They thundered down the steps ahead of me, whining when they reached the closed door at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>I trudged slowly after them. I might be imbued with some of the strongest magic in the universe, but I was an ungainly waddler just like every other pregnant woman there ever was. I finally made it to the bottom and opened the door.</p><p>The dogs created another bottleneck in the foyer, where a final door, this one clear glass, made the first threshold between me and mine and anything nasty that might come knocking. I managed to herd the dogs to one side so I could get the door open. They ran down the front porch steps and out to the sidewalk, terrifying a nanny walking a couple of babies in a double stroller.</p><p>The former Retrievers looked like oversized black mastiffs, and while I was pretty sure they wouldn&#x2019;t attack an innocent human being, they definitely looked intimidating. She gave me a look like she wanted to chastise me for defying Chicago&#x2019;s leash law, but then gave the dogs a second glance and obviously thought better of it. She hurried down the street with the kids, eager to get away.</p><p>I&#x2019;d tried to keep Lock, Stock and Barrel on leashes. But they would weave in and out and get tangled up, and finally I threw up my hands. They would do what I said&#x2014;mostly&#x2014;so why bother with leashes?</p><p>The dogs ran in three different directions to do their business. They each had a preferred spot staked out. I monitored them from the sidewalk in front of my house, wondering idly why supernatural creatures made of darkness and bearing the power to destroy souls needed to crap on the neighbor&#x2019;s lawn in the first place. Was it because I expected dogs to do such things?</p><p>The Retrievers had become more doglike as I considered them so. They were connected to me in a way I didn&#x2019;t fully understand. I could feel their presence always in the back of my mind. It wasn&#x2019;t as disturbing as it should have been. It was comforting. It kept me secure in the knowledge that they would come to my defense if I needed it. More important, they would come to the defense of my baby.</p><p>I placed my hand over my protruding belly, secure in the knowledge that my son was safe inside me. I hardly allowed myself to consider what might happen after he was born. At night I was plagued by dreams of him being rent from my arms, stolen and kept by one of my enemies&#x2014;or worse.</p><p>My own family might try to take him from me. Lucifer had made no secret of his interest in the child. Did I have the strength&#x2014;and the allies&#x2014;to keep Lucifer from my son? Maybe. But I didn&#x2019;t want to be forced to find out. I was thinking all these things, lost in my own worries, when the growling of the Retrievers brought me back to the present.</p><p>They crowded around me in a protective circle, making horrible noises low in their throats, just waiting for me to give the signal so they could leap, rip, tear.</p><p>A figure approached cautiously, the object of the Retrievers&#x2019; suspicion. The person was dressed like a college student, a slouchy gray T-shirt over loose-fitting jeans and beat-up sneakers. But the baggy clothes could not disguise the obvious strength in his body, or hide the muscles flexing in his arms. Nor did the grimy Cubs cap completely cover the gold-blond of his hair or shade the brilliance of his green eyes.</p><p>He&#x2019;d veiled his wings, and his eyes were unsure as he stopped a few feet from me. The Retrievers growled more intensely, but I put my hand on Stock&#x2019;s neck, and they quieted instantly. They were obviously still on their guard, though.</p><p>The man before me stood silently, waiting to see what I would do.</p><p>&#x201c;Samiel,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Everything was knotted up inside me. I wasn&#x2019;t sure how to feel. There was happiness, and pain, and lots and lots of anger.</p><p>Samiel was my brother-in-law, and seeing him again reminded me of happier days, when Gabriel was alive. But I was also reminded that he had left me, left me when I was in need of help, left me after I&#x2019;d taken him in and sheltered him.</p><p>He&#x2019;d left even though I&#x2019;d risked my life to save him from the court of the Grigori. He&#x2019;d left knowing I carried his brother&#x2019;s child, blood of his blood, and knowing that child needed protection.</p><p>As I thought these things the anger and the darkness rose up inside me, and he took a step back, like he could feel the pulse of dark magic. The Retrievers crouched, ready to strike.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; I asked, and my voice did not sound like my own. The effect was lost entirely on Samiel, who was deaf. But he could see my face, and read my lips, and know he was not welcome.</p><p>His hands moved tentatively, signing out the words, <i>Maddy, I&#x2019;m sorry.</i></p><p>He meant it. I could see it in his eyes, in the pleading lines of his face. He <i>was</i> sorry.</p><p>Part of me wanted to unbend immediately, to take the apology that was freely given, to return back to the way things were before.</p><p>The other part of me knew that we could never return to who we were before, and that part wanted to hold on to the anger and the hurt, to rage in pain and make Samiel suffer, make him hurt as I had when I thought everyone had abandoned me.</p><p>An image of Samiel bent and broken, blood seeping from many wounds, flashed across my brain.</p><p>That shocked me out of my anger, made me realize it was wrong, all out of proportion to his crime.</p><p>The Retrievers would take him down if I gave the words. They were attuned to my feelings, had sensed the building inferno inside me. I willed that anger away, fought to remember who I was.</p><p>&#x201c;Stand down,&#x201d; I told Lock, Stock and Barrel. They immediately sat back on their haunches and let their tongues loll out. I sensed their watchfulness despite their easy posture. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a friend.&#x201d;</p><p>Some of the tension seeped out of Samiel&#x2019;s body, but not all of it. <i>Am I? </i>he signed.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you?&#x201d; I asked, raising my eyebrow. &#x201c;Or have you come to try and eliminate me before I give birth to this baby, who just might be a monster unleashed on the world?&#x201d;</p><p>Samiel looked shocked. <i>I could never hurt Gabriel&#x2019;s child. And why would you think your own baby is a monster?</i></p><p>It was a thought I allowed myself only rarely and briefly. Mostly because I was sure I would still love and protect him, no matter what he was.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s always been a possibility, hasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Gabriel was Ramuell&#x2019;s son, and Ramuell was most definitely a monster.&#x201d;</p><p><i>But Gabriel wasn&#x2019;t. And neither are you.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure about that?&#x201d; I asked, thinking of all the things I had done, the dark compulsion that was becoming more difficult to control.</p><p>Samiel shook his head. <i>I know who you are, in your heart. I nearly killed you twice. I cut off two of your fingers. And yet you saw how my mother had twisted my love for her. You forgave me. You made me a part of your family.</i></p><p>&#x201c;And you left me,&#x201d; I said. There was no anger now, only hurt and sadness. &#x201c;I trusted you. And you left.&#x201d;</p><p><i>I was confused, </i>he signed. <i>It&#x2019;s not an excuse. I just wasn&#x2019;t sure what would happen after everyone in the world saw you on television destroying those vampires. And Chloe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>Here he stopped signing and frowned.</p><p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You wanted to protect her from the hordes you thought would be breaking down my door at any moment. She&#x2019;s your girl. I get it.&#x201d;</p><p><i>No, </i>he signed, then backtracked. <i>I mean, yes, I did want to protect her. But she&#x2019;s not my girl. At least, not anymore.</i></p><p>&#x201c;She kicked you out and now you&#x2019;re here looking for a roof over your head?&#x201d; I asked, getting annoyed again.</p><p><i>No, </i>Samiel signed, shaking his head. <i>It&#x2019;s not like that. We broke up because I wanted to come here, to make amends.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Let me guess,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Chloe didn&#x2019;t agree.&#x201d;</p><p><i>You could say that,</i> Samiel said, grinning.</p><p>I could imagine how that argument went. Chloe has an extremely strong personality. And once she&#x2019;s decided something, no force in the universe could make her change her mind.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the heaviest thing she threw at your head?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p><i>A cast-iron frying pan.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Seriously? A little clich�, that,&#x201d; I said.</p><p><i>She had just finished cooking breakfast, </i>he signed. <i>I thought it would be a safe time to raise the subject since her stomach was full.</i></p><p>&#x201c;...</p></p><h2>The Psychology of Winning</h2><p>"A heavyweight amoung motivational writers."&#x2014;Charles Paul conn, author of <i>An Uncommon Freedom</i>.</p><p>Denis Waitley's theories on human potential have made him one of America's most sought-after speakers and best-selling audiocassette program authors.

Betty and Madge, my younger sisters, went to sleep the moment I blew their candle out, but I can&#x2019;t sleep and I&#x2019;m wondering if I ever will again.<br><br>I&#x2019;ll never forget today. Everybody&#x2019;s been so happy, cheering and waving flags. But I don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;re happy, not deep down, and I&#x2019;m not happy at all. Our Jack has been a good brother to me, and we&#x2019;ve always been very close. But soon he&#x2019;ll be going away, and we might never see him again.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a war starting. I don&#x2019;t know much about wars except soldiers and sailors get killed and Jack might get killed with them. But grown-up people say different -- that wars are nothing really; they&#x2019;re a chance for young men to go off to foreign parts and be brave and come home heroes and, besides, the Hun needs a taste of his own medicine, going through Belgium and killing all the babies and the nuns.<br><br>Jack works for Crispin and Thacker, the local builders. He&#x2019;s an apprentice bricklayer, but he can turn his hand to anything. For instance, he loves taking my bike to bits and putting it back together again. He&#x2019;d love to have a motorcycle -- a Rudge or a Royal Enfield -- but he can&#x2019;t afford one. He loves his football too and plays center forward for Lambsfield. Pa wanted him to leave building and work on the railway, the same as he does, but he wouldn&#x2019;t. He wants to join up, and he&#x2019;s been waiting for the recruiting officer from the Sussex regiment to come to our village of Lambsfield. Well, the recruiting officer did come today. As soon as he heard about it, our Jack said, "You see if I&#x2019;m not a soldier of the king by this evening."<br><br>Ma cried and said, "Please don&#x2019;t, Jack," and Jack answered, "Don&#x2019;t worry, Ma. Everybody wants to go and, besides, we&#x2019;ve fought in every war there ever was and we&#x2019;ve won the lot, and we&#x2019;ll win this one too. I&#x2019;ll cut the kaiser&#x2019;s mustache off myself."<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t like Jack talking like that, and neither did Ma, because she cried into her apron, though nobody noticed but me. Pa said, "You go, boy, and good luck to you. If I was twenty years younger, I&#x2019;d go with you." Jack&#x2019;s nineteen now and old enough to be taken by the army. I&#x2019;m sixteen next January. Betty and Madge, the twins, are eleven.<br><br>Today was Saturday. In the morning a stage made of trestle tables was set up in the market square, and on it was another table spread with a Union Jack. Word traveled through the village that something unusual was going to happen. Suddenly, early in the afternoon, the high, clear tone of a bugle echoed through the village, like a summons. Jack and Pa were sitting in the living room quietly digesting Ma&#x2019;s roast mutton, potatoes, and cabbage. At the sound they both stood up. "It&#x2019;s the call," said Jack. "The army&#x2019;s here. I&#x2019;ve been waiting for this. I&#x2019;m going."<br><br>"I&#x2019;m coming with you," said Pa, and they dashed out of the house together. I ran out after them. <br><br>The call had brought most of the men in the village to the market square and quite a few women as well. I arrived just as the bugler&#x2019;s last echoes were dying away. Now he stood at attention with the bugle at his side. A soldier with a drum stood beside him. Next to them, standing ramrod straight, was a big sergeant with a red face and a bushy mustache. His boots twinkled in the sunshine.<br><br>An army officer sat behind the table. With him sat Lord Launton, Mr. Brayfield the vicar, and old Colonel Cripps, with his medals on his chest and his right sleeve pinned up because he&#x2019;d lost an arm. People said a Zulu warrior chopped it off in a terrible battle in Africa years ago. He hadn&#x2019;t been seen in the village much since his wife died last year, and I could tell that people were pleased he was here today.<br><br>There was a roll on the drum. The noise made me feel strange inside, as if it called me somewhere I didn&#x2019;t want to go. Before you could blink, the market square was full. When the soldier had finished the drumroll, he lifted the drumsticks smartly up level with his chin and stood at attention. The officer stood up.<br><br>"Men of Lambsfield," he said. He didn&#x2019;t mention women, though there were just as many there. "My name is Anstruther, Major Anstruther. You know that our beloved country is in dire peril. The British Army is our sure shield and has never shirked its duty, but our danger is so great that we need every able-bodied man in the land to flock to the colors. You, and you alone, good men of Sussex, can rid us of the scourge that threatens us and every rightthinking person in the world."<br><br>People were very quiet when he said this, until someone at the back shouted, "God save the king," and then everybody roared, "God save the king, God save the king." Major Anstruther lifted his hand for quiet. "I see you are full of the patriotic fervor that the army needs. I am proud to be an officer in the Royal Sussex Light Infantry, and Sergeant Witherspoon and Private Slack here are proud to be soldiers."<br><br>The sergeant said, "Very true, sir."<br><br>Major Anstruther went on. "And so should all you good men here today. Once you join our ranks, I promise you pride in yourselves and the knowledge that you are doing your duty for your country."<br><br>_______</p><h2>Hammerhead Six: How Green Berets Waged an Unconventional War Against the Taliban to Win in Afghanistan&#39;s Deadly Pech Valley</h2><p><strong>Two years before the action in <em>Lone Survivor</em>, a team of Green Berets conducted a very different, successful mission in Afghanistan's notorious Pech Valley. Led by Captain Ronald Fry, Hammerhead Six applied the principles of unconventional warfare to "win hearts and minds" and fight against the terrorist insurgency. </strong><br><br>In 2003, the Special Forces soldiers entered an area later called "the most dangerous place in Afghanistan." Here, where the line between civilians and armed zealots was indistinct, they illustrated the Afghan proverb: "I destroy my enemy by making him my friend." Fry recounts how they were seen as welcome guests rather than invaders. Soon after their deployment ended, the Pech Valley reverted to turmoil. Their success was never replicated. <em>Hammerhead Six</em> finally reveals how cultural respect, hard work (and the occasional machine-gun burst) were more than a match for the Taliban and Al Qaeda.</p><p>A third-generation veteran, US Army Captain <strong>Ronald Fry</strong> served in the 82nd Airborne Division and as a Special Forces team leader in Afghanistan. He has completed the military's Survival School and the Ranger, Pathfinder, Jumpmaster, and Combat Diver trainings. Fry lives with his wife and five children near San Jose and works in sales management. <br><br><strong>Tad Tuleja</strong>, author of 32 books, has taught courses on war and conflict at Harvard, Princeton, Oklahoma, and American University.<br>"The story told by Captain Ron Fry is not one you hear often when people talk about the war in Afghanistan--and that is precisely why everyone should read it. Through him, his men get to tell their history, in their own words, and anyone who cares about the truth should care about this. Hammerhead Six took a lot from them because it goes against their ethos as "quiet professionals," but as you will discover when you read this, integrity can be one of the most powerful weapons of war-and nothing but that can prepare you for the unintended consequences or the moments you wish had never happened . . ."&#x2015;<b><i>Lara Logan, <i>60 Minutes </i></i></b><br><br><em>"</em>Amidst torrents of hot brass and the smell of burnt gunpowder in Ron Fry's <i>Hammerhead Six </i>are nuggets of wisdom that can only come from a warrior leader who has lived outside the wire, among those he fought and those he sought to help. Riveting, compelling, transparently honest and emotional, <i>Hammerhead</i> <i>Six</i> is a must read for anyone wondering what could have worked in the 'graveyard of empires.'"&#x2015;<b><i>Tony Schwalm , author of <em>The Guerrilla Factory</em></i></b><br><br>"<i>Hammerhead Six</i> is a raw, hard-hitting and authentic war story that will become one of the most important books to emerge from the war in Afghanistan. Captain Fry tells a deeply human story that captures the remarkable courage of America's elite Special Forces soldiers. Reading it plunged me back into the exhilarating, heartbreaking experience of combat. Mr. President and Members of Congress, read this book immediately. If we do what Fry and his men did, we win the war in Afghanistan. Honestly it is that simple."&#x2015;<b><i>Sean Parnell, <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling author of <i>Outlaw Platoon: Heroes, Renegades, Infidels, and the Brotherhood of War in Afghanistan</i></i></b><br><br>"<em>Hammerhead Six</em> is the compelling story about a small team of brave men who were sent into the most hostile area of Afghanistan. They did what Green Berets have always done: They stood up for human rights, made friends and trained people to protect themselves. Taliban activity dropped dramatically and the surrounding area thrived. The unconventional victory of Captain Ronald Fry's unit provides inspiration and a way forward into the troubled and uncertain future. It is a textbook on how to get it right the next time."&#x2015;<b><i>Lt. Col.

He glanced back at Enopay, but the boy was thanking the bemused sentries in perfect Latin and hadn&#x2019;t yet seen the exercising Rus cavalry. To distract him, Marcellinus said, &#x201c;So, your opinion of our meeting with Decinius Sabinus?&#x201d;<br><br>Enopay followed him out and switched back to speaking Cahokian. &#x201c;It went well. With Roman help it will be much easier to prepare the fields and plant the corn. Being willing to work for what you eat, if even a few of your precious legionaries dirty their hands with Cahokian soil, will earn you huge&#x2014;oh, merda, here they come again . . .&#x201d; Abandoning his dignity, Enopay jumped behind Marcellinus. Back at the gate the sentries snorted with laughter.<br><br>The Chernye squadron was charging the fortress in a tight formation, a solid line forty horsemen wide. They wore mail shirts that were slit up the sides for easy riding, over tunics of varied color and fit. Most of the soldiers in the first rank carried long spears, some held over their heads ready to strike downward and others couched; successive waves carried bows, curved sabers, or whips. Some of their helmets were tall and fluted and others were bronzed and curved, but those warriors of the most terrifying aspect wore helmets with full steel visors that mimicked human faces.<br><br>The first rank swept by Marcellinus and Enopay, wheeling so close that the clods of earth kicked up by their horses&#x2019; hooves spattered the wooden stockade. The horses, Marcellinus knew, were a purpose-bred cross between the spirited Arabs of the Near East and the steppe ponies the Mongols rode. Their manes flowed freely, and their nostrils were bloodshot; it was not unknown for Chernye horses to kick and bite the mounts of their enemies.<br><br>The second line of horsemen was on them in moments, some playfully waving their sabers. The thunder of their passing was deafening. Marcellinus stood firm, nodding in approval despite the violence of the assault on his senses, but by that point Enopay had retreated completely and was back inside the fortress gate.<br><br>The anarchy of the Chernye&#x2019;s appearance was deceptive. Marcellinus had first encountered them when serving as a centurion in Kievan Rus half a lifetime ago. Turkic steppe peoples by background, mercenaries by trade, they were among the best horsemen in the Roman world. Bringing them as auxiliaries to fight the Mongols was truly fighting fire with fire, and it was a pity they had only a few hundred of the elite warriors. The Romans had brought two wings of cavalry from southern Rus, the Third and Fourth Polovtsians, nomadic horsemen almost as ferocious as the Mongols but without their conquering spirit. The Polovtsians were excellent, but the Chernye were better.<br><br>&#x201c;That is the last of them?&#x201d; Enopay called anxiously.<br><br>The Chernye slowed to a trot, smoothly reorganizing their ranks into a single long, straight line for their next exercise. They made that look easy. Marcellinus knew it wasn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Yes. The coast is clear.&#x201d;<br><br>Enopay stepped out of the fortress again. &#x201c;It is not that I fear the four-legs, you understand. Merely that if they should happen to make an error . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; said Marcellinus, whose own heart was still racing. &#x201c;A little prudence is quite understandable.&#x201d;<br><br>They turned and walked toward the riverbank. To their right the muddy brown ribbon of the Mizipi curved away to the south, half a mile wide. To their left stood the great fortress of the Legio III Parthica. Placed well back from the riverbank just south of the old city of Cahokia-across-the-water, the Roman fortress was enormous: a full quarter mile square with ramparts that loomed twenty feet above them. As always, the castra was a hive of activity. Now that the din of the cavalry had faded, from the other side of the tall wooden stockade they could hear the almost constant sounds of running or marching feet and the barked orders of centurions.<br><br>The imago of the Imperator fluttered over the fortress at half staff, as Hadrianus was not currently within. He and his Praetorian Guard were two days&#x2019; ride to the west, deep in the prairie on an extended training exercise with the heavy armored Roman cavalry of the Ala I Gallorum et Pannoniorum Cataphractaria. Already a seasoned general when he ascended to the Imperial purple, Hadrianus liked to lead his forces from the front. And after two years in Nova Hesperia he obviously chafed for action; Marcellinus sometimes thought the Imperator might be exultant to see the massed horsemen of the Mongol Horde thundering over the Plains toward him.<br><br>As Marcellinus and Enopay approached their birch-bark canoe on the riverbank, the boy turned to him. &#x201c;When the Romans go on into the west, you will go with them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps I should,&#x201d; Marcellinus said. &#x201c;Someone needs to keep them out of trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And I can come with you?&#x201d;<br><br>Marcellinus raised his eyebrows. &#x201c;You?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, of course, me,&#x201d; Enopay said. &#x201c;Always you go away, and always you leave me behind. You go to the Iroqua. You go to Shappa Ta&#x2019;atan. Then you sail all the way to the Market of the Mud in a dragon ship I helped you rebuild, and after that you take it up the Wemissori to the buffalo hunt, and you come back, and then you run off to Ocatan! All that time I sit here counting and writing down numbers in my book. Gaius Marcellinus sees all the land, and Enopay, who was born in it, sees nothing.&#x201d;<br><br>Even now Enopay&#x2019;s hand rested possessively on the satchel he always carried over his shoulder. Three chiefs of Cahokia had relied on Enopay&#x2019;s record keeping, and when it came to bushels of corn or war bands of Wolf Warriors, even Decinius Sabinus regularly double-checked his quartermasters&#x2019; and adjutants&#x2019; figures against Enopay&#x2019;s. It was part of the reason Enopay and Marcellinus had come to see Sabinus today.<br><br>&#x201c;We were banished,&#x201d; Marcellinus reminded him drily. &#x201c;I was hardly voyaging to entertain myself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nonetheless, I think that next time I will stow away under your decking planks. And . . . Eyanosa?&#x201d;<br><br>Marcellinus sighed inwardly. He knew what was coming next. &#x201c;Yes, Enopay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I want to know why the Romans of Hadrianus are really here, and what it is that none of you will tell us.&#x201d; The boy fixed him with a penetrating stare. Marcellinus ignored the question; this was about the twelfth time Enopay had expressed his suspicions, and as there was nothing Marcellinus could say, he preferred to remain silent.<br><br>&#x201c;So alert, the soldiers of Sabinus and Agrippa are,&#x201d; Enopay said. &#x201c;So busy training. The Imperator so keen to lead his expeditions into the Grass and keep his troops battle-ready. He sends quinqueremes and longships and canoes to map the Mizipi tributaries out of the west, and places fortresses at the river confluences, and eagerly awaits the accounts of his scouts when they return from their moonslong trips across the Plains. And yet still you will not speak of it to me, which means you cannot. But one day someone will let something slip . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Marcellinus was surprised that it had not happened already. The officers and men of two full legions of Roma knew they had come to Nova Hesperia to fight Chinggis Khan and his Mongol army. Somehow, over the last ten months not a one of them had revealed this to the mound builders. Marcellinus was quite sure that if his own 33rd Hesperian Legion were still in existence and camped here by the Mizipi, they would have leaked the information by suppertime.<br><br>From far away they heard the faint throb of a single rhythmic drum. Enopay&#x2019;s ears perked up immediately. &#x201c;Ah, good! Let us hurry.&#x201d;<br><br>Grateful for the distraction, Marcellinus followed Enopay along the southern wall of the castra toward the riverbank. The drums grew louder astonishingly quickly, now joined by the chirping of a martial flute.<br><br>&#x201c;From upriver, then!&#x201d; Enopay grinned and broke into a run. Marcellinus preserved a dignified walk.<br><br>Having just met with Decinius Sabinus in his legionary Praetorium, Marcellinus was wearing his full Roman dress uniform, and he needed to preserve dignitas in front of the officers and sentries who patrolled the wooden ramparts above him. Marcellinus possessed no authority over the troops of the Third, but had earned their grudging respect over the last year. He was not about to jeopardize that by scampering to see a ship.<br><br>Arriving next to Enopay on the riverbank, Marcellinus looked north up the Mizipi.<br><br>The quinquereme was barreling downriver in the center of the current. This was Maius, the Planting Moon, and the river was still in full spate with ice-cold meltwater.<br><br>&#x201c;Now that,&#x201d; Enopay said with satisfaction, &#x201c;is a really big canoe.&#x201d;<br><br>The quinquereme was two hundred feet long and twenty feet across at the beam. Its top deck stood fifteen feet clear of the water level, and its golden curving prow reared another twenty feet above that. The warship had its fighting towers erected at both bow and stern, with a dozen marines standing to attention atop each one. Despite the strength of the current, the quinquereme&#x2019;s oarsmen were getting little relief; the three ranks of oars dipped in perfect time with the sharp notes of the flute, slicing through the eddying water like a single machine. In a concession to the sweating soldiers at the rowing benches, the louvers were open to send a breeze into the enclosed hull.<br><br>Thousands of miles from its home harbor the warship somehow still looked brand-new. Its red bulwarks and upper decks gleamed, and the green paint at its waterline was clean and almost aglow. The large eye painted on its bow for good luck glinted with malevolence.<br><br>Along its top deck the sailors and marines stood straight-backed, in good order. When unregarded the men might stand easy, but while passing Nova Hesperia&#x2019;s major city the Legio VI Ferrata spared no effort to put on a good show.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d;<br><br>Enopay was saluting the galley, a full-arm Roman salute, and after a moment of hesitation some of the sailors saluted him back.<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Enopay said. &#x201c;It shows them respect. Massages their pride.&#x201d;<br><br>Marcellinus shook his head. Even after a full year he still felt a chill at the sight of one of Roma&#x2019;s most powerful warships under weigh. He would never forget how seven of these giant galleys had assaulted Ocatan the previous spring, powering up the mighty river to crash onto its banks, their legionaries and auxiliary cavalry spilling out to storm the Mizipian town and take it with contemptuous ease. Ocatan was rebuilt now, a proud Mizipian city once more, with the Roman presence withdrawn to a fortress and harbor area thirty miles farther up the Oyo, but the dead could never be brought back to life.<br><br>The quinquereme was quickly past them. It had two steering oars that were controlled by a single helmsman using a transverse tiller, and that helmsman was having to fight to keep the ship in a steady line and not be pushed out of the current on the shallow bend. The wake from the quinquereme&#x2019;s passing splashed up against the muddy bank.<br><br>Enopay&#x2019;s eyes gleamed. &#x201c;Perhaps I will not go west with you after all. Perhaps I will stow away on a quinquereme and go south.&#x201d;<br><br>Enopay feared horses and would sooner die than fly a Thunderbird. But when it came to warships the boy was in love. Marcellinus lifted one end of their canoe and pushed it toward the water. He held it steady for Enopay to get in, then shoved off and stepped in with a single movement. Grabbing a paddle, he dug in before the Mizipi current could push the canoe too heavily to the south.<br><br>&#x201c;I am sad you do not trust me, Eyanosa,&#x201d; Enopay said, still following the Roman galley with his eyes as it disappeared into the distance. &#x201c;I would very much like to think that one day we will be true friends again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Enopay, we will always be friends. Help me paddle.&#x201d;<br><br>All of a sudden Marcellinus wanted to get back into Cahokia and away from this river that was dominated so casually by the Roman warship. Even from here he could see the broad profile of the Great Mound rising above the other mounds of the city, the very tops of the giant poles that made up the Circle of the Cedars, and the smoke rising from thousands of huts spread over the five square miles where the ordinary people of Cahokia went about their daily business of grinding corn, drying meat, making pots, and scraping skins. High above the Great Mound he saw the swoop of tiny specks that could only be Catanwakuwa. To the mound&#x2019;s left a Sky Lantern hung in the air.<br><br>Marcellinus did not hate Roma, far from it, but the Imperium was too harsh, too brutal a thing to share the city with. Like Enopay, Marcellinus wanted the legions to move on into the west.<br><br>He doubted it would happen soon.<br><br>Enopay was watching him soberly, having picked up on his change of mood. &#x201c;Hurit?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And Anapetu,&#x201d; Marcellinus said shortly. Despite his bedazzlement the boy did, at least, recall the grim connection between the Roman quinqueremes and the slaughter at Ocatan.<br><br>Enopay nodded and pulled hard, helping to straighten their course, and Marcellinus synchronized with him with the ease of long familiarity, and then all hell broke loose with a suddenness that almost made him drop the paddle. &#x201c;Futete! What on earth?&#x201d;<br><br>Great wafts of black sooty fug were rising from the Mound of the Smoke. God only knew what noxious weeds they had to burn to create such a signal. And now from the Master Mound came the din of rocks beating against tall sheets of copper.<br><br>At almost the same moment came the braying of Roman trumpets from far south of the city.<br><br>Such alarums could only mean the city was under attack from an enemy without . . . or within.<br><br>Marcellinus and Enopay glanced at each other in horror and then, as one, dug their paddles deep into the muddy waters and bent their backs, lifting the nose of the canoe out of the water in their rush.<br><br>Even as they landed on the east bank, Mahkah raced out of the city on a piebald steed, leaning forward into the gallop. He had taken to riding as if he had been doing it all his life. Marcellinus half expected to see Hanska by his side. She was also an instinctive rider, and the two of them drilled other members of the First Cahokian together.<br><br>The Mizipi bank was boggy, and Mahkah could not bring his mount all the way to its edge. He slid off the horse and stood beside it, patting its neck to calm it. Marcellinus hurried forward. &#x201c;What? What is happening?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fight. Big fight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Another?&#x201d; Enopay looked accusingly at Marcellinus.</p><h2>Jesus and the Nonviolent Revolution</h2><p><b>Andr� Trocm� of Le Chambon</b> is famous for his role in saving thousands of Jews from the Nazis during World War II.

For a long time, nothing moved except groping tendrils of fog, playing over the muck and twisting between the hunchbacked trees. An occasional dragonfly skimmed through the reeds on crystalline wings. Overhead, the sun was fat and orange, motionless as if it had been nailed to the pale blue sky.</p><p>Then, in the distance, there was the sound of raised voices, and the rustle of someone moving through the underbrush. The dragonflies scattered. A moment later, one of the fogbanks quivered and disgorged a girl, picking her way with caution along a spit of what passed for solid ground.</p><p>She was twelve or thirteen, dressed in practical trousers and a leather vest, with her hair tied up to keep it out of the way. She was sweating freely, her pale, freckled cheeks already reddening in the sun, but her eyes were alert, scanning the trees and hollows around her.</p><p>Sitting on her shoulder was a small gray cat. His claws were fastened into her vest with desperate strength, as though he was terrified of falling off. Insofar as a cat can have an expression, this one looked very unhappy.</p><p>The girl and the cat were named Alice and Ashes-Drifting-Through-the-Dead-Cities-of-the-World (or Ashes, for short), respectively. When they reached the top of the hummock, Alice stopped and turned in a slow circle, while Ashes lashed his tail in an irritable sort of way. It was the cat who finally broke the awkward silence that had grown up between them.</p><p>&#x201c;What,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;are we doing here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re looking for some kind of monster,&#x201d; Alice said. Her master, Geryon, had told her what it was called, some complicated Latin name, but she hadn&#x2019;t committed it to memory. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to fight it. <i>You</i> know.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I know why <i>you&#x2019;re</i> here. This seems like exactly the sort of place you <i>would</i> visit, all mucky water and mud and monsters. What I want to know is why <i>I</i> should have to be here. I&#x2019;m half cat, after all. I should be above this sort of thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>You</i> are here because you did your business in Master Geryon&#x2019;s slippers,&#x201d; Alice said. &#x201c;Again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He has no proof of that,&#x201d; Ashes said, tail whipping against the back of her neck. </p><p>&#x201c;There are hardly a lot of suspects,&#x201d; she said. </p><p>&#x201c;Hmph,&#x201d; Ashes snorted.</p><p>&#x201c;You should be glad Geryon didn&#x2019;t turn you into a toad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If he had to send me to babysit you,&#x201d; the cat said, &#x201c;why did it have to be somewhere so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wet?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You should have seen the last place,&#x201d; Alice muttered. She wasn&#x2019;t sure she&#x2019;d ever be able to get into a swimming pool again. &#x201c;Now be quiet. I need to concentrate.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a rustle in the bushes, farther on, and a small creature emerged. It looked a bit like a wingless bird, with an oval body balanced on two clawed feet and a long, pointed beak. The sleek black coat that covered it was fur, though, and not feathers. </p><p>It was called a swarmer, and Alice knew that it was not, in fact, a separate creature at all, but only a part of a larger entity, like an ant or a bumblebee. The Swarm had been the first creature she&#x2019;d bound, back when she&#x2019;d known nothing of Readers or magic and she&#x2019;d accidentally stumbled into a prison-book. The individual swarmers could be almost cute, but she couldn&#x2019;t quite forget the sound of hundreds of them running after her, claws <i>tiktiktik</i>ing on the stone floor as they <i>quirked</i> for blood. </p><p>Right now she was using a few of them to scout, since the creature that occupied <i>this</i> prison-book was not being terribly cooperative. She could, after much practice, peer through their eyes without letting her real body fall over, but she still wasn&#x2019;t good at dealing with more than one of them at once. It didn&#x2019;t help that they were poorly suited to the swamp&#x2014;they were heavier than they looked, and every time one of them stepped into a puddle, it sank to the bottom like a stone and had to scramble to get out.</p><p>Alice herself was far from keen on the swamp, as a matter of fact. It was like the water and the land had gotten mixed up, somehow. Even the dry bits were covered in thick, sticky mud, and the innumerable channels and shallow ponds were covered with floating weeds that made them look just like land until she put her foot in them and muddy water poured into her boot. To top things off, the mosquitoes were eating her alive, and her sunburned skin stung whenever she squashed one.</p><p>She checked her swarmers, one by one, but all they could really see were more weeds, a disadvantage of being only a foot high. <i>This isn&#x2019;t working.</i> She sighed and let them pop out of existence. </p><p><i>At least now I can do something about the mosquitoes. </i>At the back of her mind were the threads of magic that led to her bound creatures. A silver thread for the Swarm, a deep nut-brown one for the tree-sprite, and a deep blue one for her latest acquisition: a big, toothy creature Geryon had called a devilfish, which could let her glow in the dark or breathe underwater. </p><p>Beneath them all, at the very edge of her mental reach, a final thread coiled in rings of darkest obsidian. That one led to the Dragon, which had remained stubbornly impervious to her every attempt to summon or command it. </p><p>Alice mentally wrapped the Swarm thread around herself, giving her skin the tough, rubbery resilience of the little creatures. <i>The next bug that tries to take a bite out of me is going to be very surprised.</i> Then she opened her eyes and stared around the fetid, baking swamp, frowning.</p><p>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t right,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The creature isn&#x2019;t supposed to <i>hide</i>. In every other prison-book the thing was champing at the bit for a fight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps this one&#x2019;s shy,&#x201d; Ashes said. &#x201c;Or perhaps I shouldn&#x2019;t have come with you. It may be deterred by my magnificent presence. I am very intimidating, after all.&#x201d; He yawned. &#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s probably it. Why don&#x2019;t you leave me in that tree, and you can get on with things while I have a nice little nap?&#x201d;</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sniff it out or something?&#x201d;</p><p>The cat&#x2019;s fur bristled. &#x201c;I think you may have mistaken me for some sort of <i>hound</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly,&#x201d; Alice said. She put on a sly smile. &#x201c;I just figured that whatever a stupid <i>dog</i> could do, you&#x2019;d be able to do better. Being half cat, and all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can see what you&#x2019;re trying to do, and it won&#x2019;t work,&#x201d; Ashes said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think you can bait me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fair enough, fair enough. I&#x2019;ve been thinking of asking Geryon if I could have a puppy anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A puppy?&#x201d; Ashes sputtered.</p><p>&#x201c;A golden retriever, maybe. You two would look so cute together. I can just see him licking your face with his big slobbery tongue&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right, all <i>right</i>,&#x201d; Ashes said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to get gruesome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then you can smell something?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In this muck? Not a chance.&#x201d; His whiskers twitched, and he shut his eyes. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ll be quiet for a moment, though, I may be able to <i>hear</i> something. We half-cats have excellent ears.&#x201d; One eye cracked, just slightly, so he could glare at her. &#x201c;Much better than any <i>canine</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>Alice suppressed a giggle, and stood in silence while Ashes&#x2019; ears twitched and pivoted, like tiny searchlights. Eventually he raised a paw and pointed.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if it&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re looking for,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but I can hear something big breathing, over in that direction.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s probably it,&#x201d; Alice said. &#x201c;These prison-books never seem to have much life beyond the prisoner.&#x201d; Though why this one included <i>mosquitoes</i> was beyond Alice. She started down the hillock in the direction Ashes indicated, probing ahead of her with the toe of her boot to make sure of her footing. The mud sucked at her feet with every step, but fortunately Geryon had provided her with a pair of very fine leather boots; her ordinary shoes would have been lost to the mire long ago.</p><p>She came to a stream, a channel of deeper, fast-running water moving through the muck, and hopped across it on a pair of convenient rocks. Ahead, the plants grew taller and closer together, forming an impenetrable thicket. Alice glanced at Ashes, and he nodded in that direction.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see anything,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s in there somewhere.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;</p><p>The cat only sniffed haughtily. Alice sighed and pulled the Swarm thread a little tighter around herself for protection, then crept forward.</p><p>There <i>was</i> something in there, deep inside the curling branches. A solid dark mass, like a hump of stone. But it was watching her. She edged sideways, and saw the shape move, a fraction of a degree.</p><p>&#x201c;I see it,&#x201d; Alice said. &#x201c;Hold on.&#x201d;</p><p>Ashes didn&#x2019;t bother to answer, but his claws were tiny pinpricks against her skin, even through the vest. Alice took another step forward, and another, then halted when the half-hidden creature shifted. It gave a low <i>chuff</i>, like a car engine starting up.</p><p>Then, all at once, it exploded into motion. Alice hadn&#x2019;t expected it to be so <i>fast</i>&#x2014;it crashed out of the thicket in a blur of frantic motion. She got the sense of something gray and compact, with legs working frantically and wicked, pointed horns aimed directly at her.</p><p>The Alice of a year ago would have panicked. She&#x2019;d only read about ferocious creatures in books or seen them at the zoo, safely behind bars. But that Alice no longer existed. <i>This</i> Alice was a year older and had spent the last six months as a Reader&#x2019;s apprentice. In that capacity she&#x2019;d been squashed, drowned, frozen, and otherwise nearly killed more times than she could count, and it took considerably more than a charging monster to faze her.</p><p>None of this meant that she was <i>stupid</i>, however, and she threw herself to one side at the last moment, giving the thing no time to adjust its path. The creature took quite a while to slow down once it realized it had missed, skidding through the mud and sending up a wave of dirt and pebbles as it slewed to a halt.</p><p>It was, she saw, now that she got a good look at it, a dinosaur. Not a terribly large one, certainly&#x2014;its shoulders were a bit higher than Alice&#x2019;s head, which put its eyes just about level with hers. It had a lumpy, pebble-skinned body and four stumpy, powerful legs, with broad flat feet like an elephant&#x2019;s. A short tail whipped back and forth, like an excited dog&#x2019;s. Most notable, though, was the massive crest running back from its head, from which sprouted four long, curving horns that stretched out past its beady black eyes and bird-like beak. Most of it was a dark gray, but the horns faded to pure white at the ends, and the tips looked very sharp.</p><p>One foot pawed the ground, which put Alice in mind of a bull, getting ready to charge. She got to her feet, slowly, brushing chunks of mud from her trousers.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Now we know what we&#x2019;re dealing with. Are you all right?&#x201d;</p><p>There was a silence. Alice felt the distinct absence of weight from her shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;Ashes?&#x201d; She kept her eyes glued to the dinosaur&#x2019;s, waiting for it to make a move. &#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Here,&#x201d; came the cat&#x2019;s voice, a bit higher than normal.</p><p>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Here.&#x201d;</i></p><p>Alice finally spotted him. One of the lumps on the creature&#x2019;s pebbled gray skin moved, revealing itself to be a small gray cat hanging on for dear life. All his fur was standing on end, and his tail stuck straight up like a flag.</p><p>&#x201c;How did you get <i>there</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not exactly sure,&#x201d; Ashes said. &#x201c;I thought you might get clobbered, so I abandoned ship, so to speak, and grabbed the first thing I could get a hold of.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your faith in me is astounding,&#x201d; Alice said.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought perhaps getting clobbered was part of your plan,&#x201d; Ashes said. &#x201c;You always come up with the cleverest plans. Now will you please <i>get me down from here</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>Alice took a step to the left, and the dinosaur turned to face her, still pawing the ground. She could see its hindquarters tensing as it prepared to charge. </p><p>&#x201c;That&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. may be a bit difficult,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you jump?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I would really rather not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In that case, hang on tight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Always</i> the cleverest plans&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The dinosaur charged. Ashes&#x2019; rear legs lost their grip and he scrambled madly to stay on top, his claws making no impression at all on the creature&#x2019;s thick hide. Alice guessed the needle beaks of the Swarm would have a similar lack of effect, so she kept that thread tightly wound around her. She jumped aside again, like a bullfighter, letting the creature sweep past her and into the long, tangled branches of one of the reedy swamp trees.</p><p>Before it could turn, Alice yanked on the tree-sprite thread in her mind and grabbed a branch, extending her power through it and into the main body of the tree. It was a thin, unhappy plant, eking out a bare existence in the drowned soil and constant fog, but it responded to the tree-sprite&#x2019;s magic and came alive under Alice&#x2019;s hand. The long, wispy branches snapped out and lashed themselves around the dinosaur, wrapping its thick body in green. She guided them around Ashes, who had maintained his perch by virtue of sinking his fangs into the back of the creature&#x2019;s neck.</p><p>The dinosaur struggled, tossing its head and snapping branches with its horns, but more and more limbs cocooned it as the tree bent forward like a vegetable spider. It gave a frustrated roar and turned, laboriously, toward Alice. The thing&#x2019;s strength was incredible; even the little swamp tree could have torn the arms and legs off an ordinary human, but the dinosaur fought its way forward inch by inch. It pulled the branches as far as they could go, straining like a dog at the leash, beak snapping. Alice almost felt sorry for it, trying so hard and getting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>nowhere</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </p><p>There was a <i>crack,</i> and the dinosaur inched a foot forward. Another branch tore with a wet <i>snap,</i> then two more. Ashes, who had been cautiously examining the possibility of making a jump to the ground, leaped back and grabbed on with all four legs. Alice moved away as far as she could while maintaining her focus on the tree, throwing all her power into pulling the dinosaur down.</p><p>But it was tearing free. No matter how tight she held on, the endurance of the little dinosaur seemed endless. One by one, and then in bunches, the fronds gave up the unequal struggle and tore. When half of them were gone, the trunk of the swamp tree, as thick as Alice&#x2019;s thigh, started to bend. Then, all at once, it broke in half with a <i>crack</i> like a gunshot, and the creature was free.</p><p>&#x201c;Time for another plan, I think!&#x201d; Ashes shouted.</p><p>The dinosaur shook the ragged ends of the tree branches off itself and glared at Alice with small, dark eyes. Alice stared back at it for a moment, then turned and ran.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; Ashes shouted.</p><p>&#x201c;Thinking!&#x201d; Alice shouted back.</p><p>&#x201c;Think faster!&#x201d; </p><p>Branches whipped at her face, but her Swarm-toughened skin kept her from feeling the impacts. She was more concerned about tripping on the slippery, muddy ground. The dinosaur was pounding along behind her, and rubber skin wouldn&#x2019;t help if it got her with those horns. </p><p>In a straightaway, the race would have been no contest.

The spirit and objectives of the valiant Christian nobleman who occasioned the Order have guided its activities within religious, charitable, and social institutions. Schools, hospitals, dispensaries, and asylums, associated with the mission of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, have been its beneficiaries over the centuries. Sir Alfred J. Blasco, Knight of the Collar, retraces the history of this noble order through the centuries to the present day. He elucidates how its temper has changed from the combative role of the early crusaders to the constant vigilance of the Knights and Ladies today as protectors of the Sacred Places and as generous friends of the powerless Christians of the Holy Land. This book is the long awaited resource for every Knight and Lady. It informs the reader of the requirements and privileges of the Order and the honor of Investiture. It emphasizes how the ancient code of chivalry is alive in the hallmarks of Gentiles, Charit�, Courtoisie, Loyaut�, and Largesse in the Knights and Ladies of today. The book details the organization of the worldwide Order of the Holy Sepulcher and describes the growth of the Lieutenancies in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The author recognizes the clergy and laity for the remarkable developments of the Order in the New World.</p><p></p><h2>Robert Ludlum&#39;s the Paris Option : A Covert-One Novel</h2><p>For 30 years, Robert Ludlum's novels have set the standard for the finest in international intrigue and suspense. With an unbroken string of bestsellers in almost every country in the world, Robert Ludlum's books have been enjoyed by hundreds of millions of readers, and are widely acknowledged as classics in the field. Now, after the bestselling Covert-One novels <i>The Hades Factor</i> and <i>The Cassandra Compact</i> comes the third thrilling novel in the series - <i>The Paris Option</i>.<br><br>A fiery explosion in the dark of night shatters one of the laboratory buildings in Paris's esteemed Pasteur Institute. Among the dead is Emile Chambord, one of the leaders in the global race to create a molecular - or DNA - computer. Unfortunately, Professor Chambord kept the details of his work secret, and his notes were apparently destroyed in either the bomb blast or the raging fire that followed.<br><br>The scientific community does not expect a workable DNA computer to be developed for years. But suddenly U.S. fighter jets disappear from radar screens for a full five minutes, and there's no explanation. Utilities across the Western states cease functioning, and all telecommunications abruptly stop, with devastating consequences. This is not the work of a clever hacker, although Washington, worried about a panic, assures the public it is. Only the enormous power and speed of a DNA computer could have caused such havoc.<br><br>Under the cover of visiting his friend Marty Zellerbach, who was severely injured when the Pasteur lab was destroyed, Covert-One agent Jon Smith flies to Paris to search for the connection between the Pasteur explosion and the forces now wielding the computer. Following a trail that leads him across two continents, Smith uncovers a web of deception that threatens to wreck havoc and forever reshape the world.<br></p><p>OUTSTANDING PRAISE FOR ROBER T LUDLUM'S <br><br>THE PROMETHEUS DECEPTION<br><br>"His most ingenious novel yet...a dead-on picture of contemporary corporate strategy." -<i>The New Yorker</i><br> <br>"Readers will remain in the dark right up until the explosive climax...THE PROMETHEUS DECEPTION will not disappoint."<i>-San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>"His best thriller yet."--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>"This is a rousing thriller with all the trademarks of a Ludlum bestseller...heart-pounding...fast-paced...explosive.

We are squashed around the dark oak table -- just recently stripped and restored by Joan, and still stinking of varnish -- and we are happy because we know we are getting chicken tonight.</p><p>My four sisters are all wearing variations of maroon velvet dresses with white lace collars, all made by Joan from the same Butterick pattern. Madonna hates hers, but Joan has told her to "shut up and put it on" and has made her wear it anyway. Another night, Madonna might have run to our dad, and he'd probably have given in and let her wear something else, but tonight he was at a Knights of Columbus meeting and arrived home just in time for dinner.</p><p>As always -- not because we are poor, but because Joan is frugal -- she has only made two chickens to divide between the ten of us. I feel as if I've spent half my life fighting to get the breast, which I love, but failing, simply because I'm too slow off the mark and everyone else beats me to it. Tonight, though, I've made up my mind that I'll get the breast at last.</p><p>But before I can swing into action, it's my turn to say grace.</p><p>We all stand up and hold hands.</p><p>I take a deep breath. "Dear Lord, thank you for this beautiful day. Thank you for all my brothers and sisters."</p><p>My elder brother Marty, who has just been caught smoking in the basement and has been disciplined by my father, snickers.</p><p>My younger sister Melanie -- born with a silver streak on the left side of her hair, across her left eyebrow and left eyelash -- assumes I'm sincere and flashes me a tender, beatific smile.</p><p>My elder brother Anthony, who is coming down from a bad peyote trip and is still clutching Carlos Castaneda's <i>Separate Reality</i>, closes his eyes tightly.</p><p>My sister Paula, always the underdog, makes a face.</p><p>My baby half sister, Jennifer, gurgles.</p><p>My baby half brother, Mario, in his high chair, plays with his rattle.</p><p>My father and my stepmother exchange a quick approving glance.</p><p>My older sister Madonna lets out a loud, prolonged yawn.</p><p>I glare at her and go on.</p><p>"Thank you for Grandma Elsie and Grandma Michelina. Thank you for our father and for Joan. Thank you, dear Lord, for the food we are about to receive, and could I please have a chicken breast tonight?"</p><p>Everyone cracks up, even Madonna.</p><p>I strike out. I don't get the chicken breast. Not quick enough off the mark because I am still heartily laughing at my own witticism. Poetic justice, I suppose. But at least I don't go hungry -- because no matter how often my sister Madonna has portrayed herself as the quintessential Cinderella and insinuated that Joan was our wicked stepmother, Joan has never starved or mistreated us.</p><p>On the other hand, she doesn't believe in lavishing expensive food on us either. She always reserves any delicacies -- Greek olives, Italian salami, expensive cookies -- for her guests, whereas the kids' biggest treat is granola. Whenever Joan isn't around, no matter how much else we've eaten that day, just for the hell of it we sneak into the kitchen and pilfer a gourmet cookie earmarked for the guests.</p><p>One Saturday morning, when I am fifteen, she summons us all to what she terms "the Formal Dining Room." She has spent the last few months redecorating it, during which time we have been banned from going in there. I assume she is about to unveil her latest decorating feat to us. While my siblings aren't exactly clamoring to view the new and upgraded dining room, I, at least, am slightly curious about the results. I just hope that Joan doesn't expect me to applaud her efforts, because insincere applause isn't yet part of my repertoire. That will come later, on the many occasions when I sit through one of my sister's movie performances and don't want to hurt her feelings.</p><p>Consequently, I find it difficult to mask my reaction when we file into the Formal Dining Room. Moss-green shag carpet, strips of stained wood on the walls, tiles in between them that Joan describes as "antiqued," one of her favorite words. I know it's the seventies, but nonetheless, my design instincts have already begun to form and I am far from overwhelmed.</p><p>But Joan hasn't summoned us to the Formal Dining Room so we can admire her decorating prowess, but because one of us kids is in deep trouble. In Judge Dredd mode, she announces that the angel food cake she's only lately bought for coffee with her friends is missing, and she wants the culprit to come clean.</p><p>"You'll sit here all day, until someone confesses," she decrees. None of us says a word. She puts an Andy Williams album on the turntable. I think to myself, <i>Torture by music?</i> I fix my eyes on the Asian landscape -- a fall scene of junks sailing along a river -- that our father has brought back from his recent L.A. trip and mentally repaint it myself.</p><p>After an hour, Joan leaves the room. We sit around the table in silence, examining one another's sheepish faces, each of us secretly trying to guess the identity of the culprit. Although I don't openly accuse her, I mentally finger Madonna for the crime, simply because I know that although angel food cake tastes too bland for her, she may like the name. Besides, filching it would be another notch in the gun that -- figuratively speaking -- she has continually pointed in Joan's direction. Half an hour later, Joan returns and announces that a neighbor has come forward and says he witnessed the theft through our kitchen window. Moreover, he has identified the thief: me.</p><p>I am innocent, but have no way of proving it. Besides, my friends are waiting for me in our tree house. They've just received the latest <i>Playboy</i> in the mail, and I am dying to get out of the house and sneak a peek at it. So I confess to having stolen the angel food cake. I am duly punished for my transgression: grounded for a week, without any TV. Many years later, the true culprit is unmasked when Paula confesses that she took the angel food cake, but by then it was far too late, as I had long since been punished. My own fault, of course, for having confessed to something that I didn't do. The birth of a behavior pattern, I suppose, and a harbinger of things to come.</p><p>Since Joan married our father, one of the pleasanter rituals she's established is that each of us can select our own birthday cake. Madonna always picks strawberry shortcake. My choice is always pink-lemonade ice cream cake.</p><p>Soon after the angel food cake debacle, I am on tenterhooks as to whether Joan will still make me my favorite cake. To my relief, now that I have been punished for supposedly stealing and have paid the price for my crime, Joan has forgiven me. And I get my pink-lemonade ice cream birthday cake after all.</p><p>Making cakes is Joan's greatest culinary accomplishment. But in general, she was an abysmal cook back then. She makes Spanish rice, but forgets to put in the rice and often serves us a massive bowl of stew from the freezer and, with a self-satisfied smile, says, "I just cooked this fresh."</p><p>"Freezer fresh!" we all chant under our breaths, careful that our father doesn't hear us because we don't want to make him mad. He demands that we treat Joan with the highest respect and insists we call her Mom. All of us struggle with the respect mandate and, for many years, practically gag when we obey our father and address Joan as Mom.</p><p>My natural mother, who was named Madonna, died when I was just three years old. I have only one clear memory of her. I am running around the green-grass backyard of our small, single-level home on the wrong side of the railroad tracks and step on a bee. As I cry my eyes out, my mother gently places me on her knee and soothes the sting with ice. I feel safe, protected, and loved. For the rest of my life, I will yearn to recapture that same feeling, but will always fail.</p><p>The sad truth is that I was too young when my mother died to ever really know her. For me as a child, the only way in which she existed was through pictures. One of the many I loved was taken of her sitting astride a buffalo -- she is so vibrant, so charismatic, so alive, such a star. Looking at her then, I couldn't believe she was dead, that I would never see her again. Nor could I reconcile her joie de vivre with her extreme piety.</p><p>I only learned about my mother's intense religious devotion twenty years ago, when my father sent all of us a bundle of her love letters to him. She wrote those letters when my father was away in the air force, and he and my mother were courting.</p><p>I read just one of these romantic missives written by my mother. After reading it, I couldn't bring myself to read any more as I am not a very religious man, and the extremism of my mother's religious sentiments is difficult for me to grasp. Although her letter is loving and sweet, to me it seems a bit fanatical. All about how God is keeping her love for my father alive, God this and God that. I am unable to read any more because I have quite a different picture of my mother in my head and don't want to distort it.</p><p>My father sends Madonna copies of those same letters, and I imagine that she also reads them.

The narrative follows Julian West, who goes to sleep in Boston in 1887 and wakes in the year 2000 to find that the era of competitive capitalism is long over, replaced by an era of co-operation. Wealth is produced by an &#x201c;industrial army&#x201d; and every citizen receives the same wage. </p> <p> This edition contains a rich selection of appendices, including excerpts from Bellamy&#x2019;s <em>Equality</em> and other writings; contemporary responses (by William Morris, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and others); excerpts from utopian works by Morris and William Dean Howells; and an excerpt from Henry George&#x2019;s <em>Progress and Poverty</em>. </p></p><h2>The Oxford History of Western Music, Vol. 6: Resources- Chronology, Bibliography, Master Index</h2><p>a narrative history from the &#34;earliest notations&#34; (taken to be around the eighth century) to the late twentieth century. It was written by the American musicologist Richard Taruskin. Published by Oxford University Press, it is a multi-volume work, but is shorter than the same publisher&#39;s The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, which is written by multiple contributors. The Oxford History of Western Music appeared in 2005. A paperback edition in five volumes followed in 2009. It is available online, but is not part of Oxford Music Online, the portal which gives electronic access to the New Grove Dictionary (Grove Music Online) and The Oxford Companion to Music.[1]</p><p>The history of "history"--our changing perspectives on the act of narrating and trying to "recapture" the past--encompasses the most profound seismic shifts in modern consciousness. Once seemingly commonsensical, the science-aspiring ambition of historiography to recount the past "as it actually was" (to borrow Leopold von Ranke's famously misunderstood phase) now betrays anachronistic naivete, if not a dangerous arrogance masquerading as objectivity. And the business of cultural history provides a particularly fascinating--and contentious--index to the larger issues at stake. The very urgency of the debate over "how" to tell the story (and indeed what the story is) continues to intensify in proportion to the uncertainty of our times. <p> </p><p> Considering its official title (bearing an impressive imprimatur from Oxford University Press, the vanguard of scholarly reference works), Richard Taruskin's grand opus might appear at first glance to eschew the more-heated arenas of debate involving cultural history. Quite the contrary: Taruskin throws down the gauntlet at once and passionately joins in the fray. In the process, he strips the story of music's development in the West (i.e., Europe and America) of its deceptively innocuous trappings and received ideas, thrusting it into the spotlight of contemporary critical inquiry. The result, virtually a priori, is a highly controversial reexamination of a narrative that will cause even the most open-minded music lover to do a number of double-takes. What's extraordinary about Taruskin's achievement is how immensely engrossing, insightful, provocative, fresh, and downright brilliant the "history of Western music" becomes in his weaving of it. </p><p> </p><p> But why yet another sweeping history when the <i>New Grove Dictionary of Music</i> has been recently overhauled (in an edition to which Taruskin prolifically contributed), and when long-standing classic texts such as Paul Henry Lang's <i>Music in Western Civilization</i> continue to be reissued? The heart of the matter lies in the very ambition behind this new history. First, some of the fun factoids: at nearly 4,000 pages (along with an additional resource volume containing master index, chronologies, and bibliography), <i>The Oxford History of Western Music</i> weighs nearly 20 pounds and took a decade to write. In other words, this isn't history-by-committee. Its perspective from the point of view of one massively learned individual is at once the work's chief strength and its Achilles heel. Taruskin's powerful voice echoes the kind of "old-fashioned" synthesis, with its attempt at an "overarching trajectory," of such pioneering cultural historians as Jacob Burckhardt or perhaps even the epic sweep of Gibbon's The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&#x2014;-an antidote to the curse of ivory-tower specialization. But, more crucially, Taruskin arms that voice with the toolkit of contemporary historiography to pursue a critical rethinking of how Western music turned out as it did, and where it is today. His singular viewpoint anchors Taruskin's attempt to show that "the literate tradition of Western music is coherent at least insofar as it has a completed shape." </p><p> </p><p> It's important to realize, as Taruskin early acknowledges, that his work is meant not as a stock-taking "survey" but as a history. That is, it involves an unfolding both of that larger coherence and of many smaller narratives that are its tributaries: not of the artwork (or composer) alone, but those of its production, its social and political context, and its (often-changing) reception as integral components of musical "meaning." Taruskin's aim is to filter out the distorting perspectives of "historicism" (the myth of purposeful, goal-oriented evolution through history) and aestheticism (which considers the artwork as a "pure," timeless entity). Along the way, this means smashing rows upon rows of icons and legends (not surprisingly, the bulk of these stemming from the 19th-century Germanic tradition, but also comprising a good deal of 20th-century received ideas about Stravinsky, Soviet composers such as Shostakovich, and various postwar "elitisms"). </p><p> </p><p> Inevitably, Taruskin doesn't prove immune to resorting to some legends of his own. In an extraordinary overview of Wagner, for example, he persuasively debunks the routine citation of <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> as pointing toward the coming "collapse of tonality," demonstrating how such thinking is the epitome of "the historicist tendency to write history backward with an eye toward giving the present a justification." Yet he's also capable of reducing the Wagner of the <i>Ring</i> to an obsession with a "cult of strength" in what is an otherwise deeply insightful discussion of "the Wagner problem." In terms of the larger stakes of this history, Taruskin's strongly argued debating points (and debunkings) at times veer in more eccentric directions, especially when it comes to such pivotal figures as Stravinsky, who gets a particularly intense thrashing. And regardless of Taruskin's theoretical stances, the reader must be alert to alarming occasional lapses of "mere" fact (how, one wonders, could an editorial team of over 40 not notice the claim that <i>Carmina burana</i> is scored for eight soloists in their fact checks, or fail to ensure that the endnotes match actual citations in the text?) Other tics, such as the author's fondness for scare quotes, may leap out depending on one's particular allergies. </p><p> </p><p> Despite its imperfections, Taruskin's work is undeniably a stunning and stimulating achievement. It's impossible to describe adequately the sheer artfulness of his method, whereby he can distill a multiple series of investigations into a few wonderfully insightful sentences. Ever the master contrapuntalist, Taruskin weaves his various levels of discourse into a meaningful whole. There is true virtuosity in his ability to toggle from social history to in-the-trenches musicological analysis, zeroing in with his uncanny intuition to the most rewardingly illustrative points. His method of the exemplifying metonym--using just a few examples to wring out maximum insight, like the linear perspective of Renaissance artists--becomes a tour de force in his examination of figures such as Du Fay, D. Scarlatti, J.S. Bach, Beethoven, Schoenberg, or Britten. Taruskin's scope moreover is as radically reorienting as the Big Bang theory when it comes to the relative proportions he accords the narrative of Western music. Beginning with the advent of "literate" musical culture in Carolingian times, he devotes a great deal of attention to what was long thrown together as the "pre-Bach" era. Even more radically, around 40% of the total text is devoted to music of the 20th century (two of the five volumes of the history proper). Within this span, amid all its mind-boggling diversity, a number of centripetal themes emerge: the interdependence of "absolute" and "program" music, the interplay of oral and folk with literate musical cultures, the power of myth, and the possibility for musical "meaning." Taruskin's journey is endlessly fascinating, and his work makes an enormous contribution to the field. For all the controversy it's destined to generate, it will become impossible to ignore. Perhaps its surest mark of success is the sense of urgent importance and connectedness with which this history invests the cultural matter of music. Wherever you dip in, Taruskin invites an open conversation that leaves plenty of new, revealing perceptions in its wake, but probably more questions that when you started. Indeed, there's a sense that Taruskin would consider his work to have failed if the reader were only to nod in assent to all he has to say. <i>--Thomas May</i></p><br><strong>Richard Taruskin</strong> is professor of musicology at the University of California, Berkeley.

Kotler, not a religious man, suddenly found himself drawn to the sport of surfing as if it were the cornerstone of a new faith. Why, he wondered, when there was nothing left to believe in, could he begin to believe in something as unlikely as surfing. What was belief anyway? How did it work in the body, the brain, our culture, and human history?</p><p>Into this mix came a strange story. In 2003, on a surf trip through Mexico, Kotler heard of "the conductor," a mythical surfer who could control the weather. He'd heard this same tale eight years earlier, in Indonesia, but this time something clicked. With the help of everyone from rebel surfers to rocket scientists, Kotler undertakes a three year globetrotting quest for the origins of this legend. The results are a startling mix of big waves and bigger ideas: a surfer's journey into the biological underpinnings of belief itself.</p></p><p><p><b>Steven Kotler</b>'s novel <i>The Angle Quickest for Flight</i> was a <i>San </i><i>Fran</i><i>cisco Chronicle</i> bestseller and won the William L. Crawford IAFA Fantasy Award. His nonfiction has appeared in the <i>New York Times Magazine, GQ, National Geographic, Details, Wired, Men's Journal, Maxim, Salon,</i> and elsewhere. He has surfed all over the world and lives in Los Angeles, California.</p>After surviving a battle with Lyme disease, Kotler finds himself searching for a reason to live and turns to his love of surfing. The novelist (<i>The Angle Quickest for Flight</i>) and journalist travels to Mexico, where he hears a story about a magical being called "the Conductor," who controls the surf. Having heard the same tale eight years earlier while surfing in Indonesia, Kotler decides to seek out the legend's source while researching the inherent mysticism of surfers and their sport. Detailing his journey and findings, Kotler creates a work that combines the most compelling elements of memoir, travelogue and scholarly abstract into an accessible tale of physical and mental adventure. Up for anything, Kotler seeks out big waves, bungee jumping and a risky helicopter ride. He also delves into far-flung topics: surfing's history, Joseph Campbell's work on myths, Jungian psychology, Zen Buddhism, government "weather modification" experiments and the religious beliefs of islanders like the Maori and Hawaiians. The book reaches its peak when Kotler focuses on the inner workings of the human brain. His reasoning of how genetic and biological factors combine with physical and emotional experiences to create the spiritual "funkytown" feeling unique to surfing is both enlightening and inspirational. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He refused to fly and wouldn't be driven at more than thirty miles an hour. He avoided having his picture taken and was terrified of being assassinated.

No wonder he made only six movies in the past thirty-five years. <br><br>But what was he really like?<br><br>For more than two years, Frederic Raphael collaborated closely with Stanley Kubrick on the screenplay of what was to be the director's final movie, Eyes Wide Shut. Over time, as his professional caution was replaced by a certain affection, Kubrick lowered his guard for Raphael as he never had with journalists or biographers, to reveal much about his early life in the cinema and of the reverses and humiliations he had to endure. They spoke for hours about a variety of subjects, from Julius Caesar to the Holocaust, from Kubrick's views about other directors to reminiscences of the many stars with whom both men had worked (or nearly worked)--Kirk Douglas, Audrey Hepburn, James Mason, Peter Sellers, Marisa Berenson, Sterling Hayden, Marlon Brando, and Gregory Peck.<br><br>Here, with his own distinctly cinematic style, Raphael chronicles their often fiery exchanges, capturing Kubrick's voice as no one else could.

And while Frederic Raphael instantly drew criticism and controversy from Kubrick's family and friends for describing Kubrick as "the sedentary wandering Jew, rootlessly rooted within his own defenses," this and other remarks must be considered in context. <i>Eyes Wide Open</i> must ultimately be seen to reflect Raphael's conflicting emotions about a filmmaker he clearly admires and respects, even if their collaboration resulted in equal parts elation, exasperation, and hard-won rewards.<p> Using notebook entries, vivid recollection, and re-created scenes in screenplay format, Raphael paints a portrait as revealing of himself (if not more so) than of Kubrick, and neither man comes across without blemish. Simultaneously self-indulgent, frustrating, and fascinating in its attempt to probe Kubrick's closely guarded psyche (a mission Raphael ultimately fails to accomplish), the book finally reveals--in fragments of sensitive insight--that Kubrick's reputation as a reclusive genius did in fact hide a very complex, intensely intelligent, and surprisingly <i>human</i> being. In one passage Raphael observes that "Stanley was so determined to be aloof and unfeeling that my heart went out to him. Somewhere along the line he was still the kid in the playground who had been no one's first choice to play with." Whether such observations are an accurate representation of Kubrick's personality is beside the point; that Raphael made the observation speaks volumes of both men, and this book is filled with similar revelations.</p><p> In addition to offering a privileged look at Kubrick's collaborative process, the book also reveals elusive details about Kubrick the man--pet lover, intellectual challenger, gracious host--and the result is a warmer image of him than that afforded by decades of distant speculation by journalists too willing to perpetuate the "myth" of Kubrick as omnipotent genius. If Raphael's book invites criticism and charges of blatant opportunism (with Kubrick unable to defend himself), it also provides a rare and often fascinating look at an artist who constantly eluded the gaze of outsiders. Raphael takes us inside Kubrick's gated domain, and we're grateful for the visit. If the truth resides somewhere between the protest of Kubrick's family and the insights presented here, we can at least use this book as a guide through previously uncharted territory. <i>--Jeff Shannon</i></p>The American-born, British-educated writer Frederic Raphael is the author of nineteen novels and four short story collections, including Richard&#39;s Things, The Glittering Prizes, Oxbridge Blues, and most recently Coast to Coast, as well as the original screenplays for John Schlesinger&#39;s Darling, for which he won an Academy Award, and Stanley Donen&#39;s Two for the Road. He has adapted for the screen the works of Thomas Hardy (Far from the Madding Crowd), Iris Murdoch (A Severed Head), Henry James (Daisy Miller) and Arthur Schnitzler (Traumnovelle, filmed as Eyes Wide Shut).

The following year Stieglitz began his portrait of his future wife, according to his idea that a portrait was not just one photograph, but a series that would portray the many aspects of a person. Expanded from the original edition, which was prepared with O&#39;Keeffe&#39;s assistance in 1978, this book includes a representative selection of 79 of the hundreds of photographs which were taken over a period of 30 years.</p><p></p><h2>Vibrant Food: Celebrating the Ingredients, Recipes, and Colors of Each Season [A Cookbook]</h2><p><b>The vivid colors of fresh produce inspire this artistic collection of whole foods recipes from the creator of the acclaimed blog <i>The Year in Food</i>.</b><br><br>Kimberly Hasselbrink, photographer and creator of the acclaimed blog <i>The Year in Food,</i> invites you to look at ingredients differently and let their colors inspire you: the shocking fluorescent pink of a chard stem, the deep reds and purples of baby kale leaves, the bright shades of green that emerge in the spring, and even the calm yellows and whites of so many winter vegetables.

Her work appears regularly in the Etsy blog, and her photography clients include Williams Sonoma,<i> Bon Appetit</i>, Harvard Common Press,<i> Kinfolk</i> magazine, Edible San Francisco, Foodzie, Rewinery, Grist, and CUESA. <i>The Year in Food</i> has been praised by The Kitchn, Food52, &nbsp;Gourmet Live, &nbsp;<i>Anthology</i> magazine, &nbsp;Refinery 29, Spry Living, and Babble. <i>Bon Appetit</i> named Kimberley's Instagram account one of the fifteen Best Accounts for Food Lovers.INTRODUCTION<br>It was a head of overripe purple cauliflower<i>&#x2014;</i>the last from my friend Nicole&#x2019;s winter garden&#x2014;that began my obsession with colorful produce. The cauliflower was close to flowering, and probably a little bitter, but I was enamored. I had never seen purple cauliflower before or, at least, it had never captured my attention so completely. I began to consider vegetables differently&#x2014;regarding them not in terms of what ingredients would make a meal but what colors inspired me. And once I began hunting for color, it popped up everywhere: the shocking fluorescent pink in the rib of a humble chard stem, the flecks of deep reds and purples in baby kale leaves, the pale shades of new green that emerged in the spring, and even the quiet yellows and whites in so many winter vegetables.<br><br>Thinking about produce in terms of color reinvigorated my relationship not only with food but also with photography. It brought me to a place of curiosity, an inquisitive examination of the natural world through its structure, its tones, and its hues. Formalizing this preoccupation with a new series on my blog,&nbsp;<i>The Year in Food</i>, was an easy next step. Called &#x201c;Color Studies,&#x201d; the purpose of the series was to celebrate color in produce. The project resonated with people. And it captured and held my attention and interest. Hiding out in the Color Studies were the beginnings of this book.&nbsp;<br><br>One of the greatest discoveries in working on this book was that flavor and texture are equally important in creating a dish one can rightfully call vibrant.&nbsp;<br><br>I love to improvise in the kitchen, driven by a desire to experiment, to think about ingredients creatively, to brainstorm.&nbsp;<i>Vibrant Food</i>&nbsp;is the result of that brainstorming: its purpose is to start with color, employing flavor and texture to build gorgeous, dynamic dishes. My hope is that it is equal parts inspiration and accessibility. Even if you can&#x2019;t find nettles, fresh chickpeas, kumquats, quince, or some of the other less common ingredients I&#x2019;ve grown so fond of, I hope that curiosity will get the better of you. Perhaps you&#x2019;ll bring a striking vegetable home and mull over it, and then build a colorful dish around that vegetable. That is how I cook.&nbsp;<br><br>Which is to say, this book showcases how I like to eat. Some colorful ingredient will capture my fancy, and I&#x2019;ll begin to think about it. I&#x2019;ll think about its texture, what would taste good with it, whether it needs sweet or salt or acid, and I&#x2019;ll build a recipe from there. We all have our preferences and quirks, and I don&#x2019;t think that mine have ever been more abundantly clear than in the process of making this book. If I had my way, I would add olive oil, Greek yogurt, feta cheese, chipotle powder, paprika, arugula, kale, cardamom, or eggs to nearly everything that I eat. They are the ingredients that I return to again and again.&nbsp;<br><br>And speaking of food preferences, one thing should be noted: I stopped eating wheat in November 2011. I did so because of long-term, chronic digestive issues that were deeply interfering with my ability to function and enjoy life. I had known for a long time that I should cut wheat out of my diet, but it was no easy task. When I finally did so, my digestion began to function healthily again, and I have kept with a gluten-free diet ever since. Most of the dishes in this book that use pasta noodles or wheat flour have been tested both with and without wheat gluten. I have grown to love how dynamic nut and grain flours are, and how much flavor and texture they add to a dish. The choice is yours to make. If you&#x2019;re partial to wheat noodles and wheat flour, carry on as you know. If you&#x2019;re curious about eating gluten-free, this is an opportunity to experiment with brown rice noodles, oat flour, almond flour, and the like.<br><b>Seasonality and structure</b><br>I love eating produce at the peak of its season. It&#x2019;s a very intuitive way of getting the best fruits and vegetables, and it&#x2019;s also an intuitive way to organize this book. But what&#x2019;s in season and when that season begins and ends is wildly variable depending on climate and location. So take it with a grain of salt. Some produce peaks late in its season, some produce straddles the end of one season and the beginning of another.&nbsp;<br>I have organized the produce in each section according to when it peaks in the season, from early to late.<br><br><b>Eating intuitively</b><br>Sometimes the joy of food can get lost in the nuances of nutrition. Over the past few years, a lot of information has come out on the nutritive value of phytonutrients in colorful vegetables and fruits. I care deeply about what I eat, but not to the point that I will choose one vegetable over another because one has more antioxidants. And so goes this book: if we intuitively let color guide our choices, we can trust that we&#x2019;re eating well, and taking care of ourselves, and celebrating food for its dynamism, its vibrancy, its flavor, and its colors, as much as we are for its benefits to our health.<br><br>--------------------------<br><br><b>Rhubarb Compote&nbsp;</b><br>with Cacao Nibs<br>Serves 4<br><br>Rhubarb&#x2019;s bracing, tart flavors come alive in this dessert. I love the crunch and savory chocolate notes that the cacao nibs provide, along with the cool tang of cr�me fra�che. It&#x2019;s an intoxicating mix.&nbsp;<br><br>In a large pot, combine the rhubarb, honey, water, and lemon juice. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the pot, and toss the pod in as well. Stir gently&nbsp;<br>to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook, covered, for 12 to 15 minutes, stirring halfway.&nbsp;<br><br>Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly. Discard the vanilla bean pod. Divide the compote among 4 bowls. Serve warm or at room temperature with&nbsp;<br>a dollop of cr�me fra�che and a generous sprinkling of cacao nibs.</p><h2>Shakespeare Stories</h2><p>Twelve Shakespeare plays presented afresh by Leon Garfield in narrative form. These are not simple retellings, but more like a refashioning of the dramas as stories, which remain true to the essential spirit of the original versions. The author has captured all the richness of character, plot, mood and setting in Shakespeare&#39;s works. It is the perfect introduction to Shakespeare for the young.</p><p>LEON GARFIELD won many awards including The Carnegie Medal, The Guardian Award, The Whitbread Prize and the Children&#39;s Book Award. He is best known for his historical novels. Leon Garfield died in 1996. MICHAEL FOREMAN is one of the leading children&#39;s illustrators working today. He has won many prestigious awards including the Smarties Book Prize and the Federation of Children&#39;s Book Groups&#39; Children&#39;s Book Award. He lives in London and St Ives, Cornwall.Grade 5 Up The value of this book will depend upon the intended use. From the deep orange endpapers, through generous margins and clear print, to the multitude of evocative illustrations, the volume is a delight. Foreman's intense watercolors and lively ink-wash illustrations go far to help create the moods of the stories. The storytelling is unevenGarfield is able to evoke the heartbreak of King Lear but fails to convey the crazy humor of Twelfth Night but it is generally competent enough. However, Garfield's visual descriptions are so specific and so lavish; his line interpretations so absolute that he almost guarantees that any given production will seem inadequate after such a buildup! Libraries that have Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare (Macmillan, 1963; o.p.) or Chute's Stories from Shakespeare (World, 1956; o.p.) probably don't need to add this luxury item. Garfield covers only 12 of the best-known plays, while the Lambs tell 20 tales and Chute leads the pack with 36. While Garfield's style is more accessible to modern readers and covers the plays more completely than the evasive Victorianisms of the Lambs, he must take a back seat when compared with the lucid straightforward prose in Chute's book.

Although the writing took 10 years, sure it reads as if it were no trouble at all, at all for the author. As have many of her fellow native Irish storytellers, she finds inspiration in the island's legendary heroes. But her uproariously funny, scarely, suspenseful fairy tale is entirely original. The enchantment begins at once as two evil spirits fly to Galway to await The Morrigan, Great Queen: "All the time invisible; except once, when they swooped down on a basking shark and frightened it silly. . . All the time silent; except when they tapped their teeth with their finger-nails and sent lightning. . . ." In the city, the spirits become two strange women on a motorbike, followed by their hounds. "All this because a boy was about to buy a book in the second-hand bookshop, in the small grey city." The boy is Patrick Joseph (Pidge), urged by something he doesn't understand to own the ancient, tattered pages; it looks very boring. But he takes "A Book of Patrick's Writing" home and it throws him, as well as his five-year-old sister Brigit, into the war on the side of noble Cuchulain against wicked Morrigan. Moving into the house near to the children, the demonic females fail again and again to steal the miraculous volume. Pidge and Brigit escape by a hair's breadth from each deadly trapat times saved by fairies in the guise of tinkers, frequently by the mischief created by silver-tongued Brigit, a genius at telling lies that frustrate the foe. All the while, Cuchulain's valiant army and The Morrigan's forces are rushing to a decisive battle. In an astonishing finale, O'Shea describes a lyrical moment when Pidge and Brigit try to remember who has left gifts for them . . . and why. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Forbidden (The Books of Mortals)</h2><p>New York Times bestselling author Ted Dekker teams with Tosca Lee to create this gripping thriller set in a desolate future.<br><br>Many years have passed since civilization's brush with apocalypse.

In the introduction Elizabeth Jennings who was herself among the most distinguished of contemporary poets pays tribute to Pitter&#x2019;s acute sensibility and deep integrity&#x2019; and refers to her precision in observing Nature, her skill with verse forms and the frequency with which she achieves a beautifully communicated vision&#x2019;.</p><p>Ruth Pitter was born at Ilford in 1897. Her mother and father were both teachers in the East End, and introduced her at an early age to poetry and to an enjoyment of the countryside on the edge of London. Her first poems appeared in print in A.R Orage's New Age when she was still at Coborn School for Girls, Bow. Hilaire Belloc helped to publish her First Poems in 1920, and subsequent volumes established her reputation on both sides of the Atlantic as one of the most distinctive voices in 20th-century poetry: her work was praised by Yeats and C.S. Lewis, and she was described by Lord David Cecil as the most moving of living English poets, and one of the most original&#x2019;. A younger generation of writers, among them Thom Gunn and John Wain, was equally enthusiastic. Ruth Pitter received the Hawthornden Prize in 1937, the Heinemann Award for Literature in 1954 and was the first woman recipient of the Queen&#x2019;s Gold Medal for Poetry in 1955.

The 2008 presidential candidates reached out to an unprecedented number of racial and religious voting constituencies including African Americans, Latinos, Muslims, Mainline Protestants, Catholics, Evangelicals, Jews, women, the non-religious, and more. Religion, Race, and the American Presidency focuses on the roles of these racial and religious groups in presidential elections over the last forty years, and in elections since 2000 in particular. Drawing upon survey data, interviews, and case studies of recent presidents, the contributors examine the complicated relationships between American presidents and key racial and religious groups. The paperback edition features a new capstone chapter on the 2008 elections.<br><br>Contributions by Brian Robert Calfano, David G. Dalin, Paul A. Djupe, Gast�n Espinosa, John C. Green, Melissa V.

Hence this 1,200-mile journey down the Ganges River, which the author undertook in 1963 in the company of his wife and an ever-changing crew of Indian retainers. What moved him to take the trip? Partly it was the memory of his military service in India more than two decades before. And as he confesses, Newby has a lifelong and perhaps congenital love of rivers: "I like exploring them. I like the way in which they grow deeper and wider and dirtier but always, however dirty they become, managing to retain some of the beauty with which they were born." Few rivers grow quite as dirty as the Ganges, which also goes by such nicknames as <i>Atula</i> ("Peerless"), <i>Savitri</i> ("Stimulator"), and <i>Bhinna-brahmanda-darpini</i> ("Taking pride in the broken egg of Brahma"). And few accounts of this mighty waterway could possibly be as acute and hilarious as <i>Slowly down the Ganges</i>, which Newby first published in 1966.<p> As always, the author finds human comedy everywhere he looks. Take his initial departure from beneath the Balawali Bridge, where a highly emotional crowd has gathered to see him off: </p><blockquote> Two hundred yards below the bridge and some twelve hundred miles from the Bay of Bengal the boat grounded in sixteen inches of water.... I looked upstream to the bridge but all those who had been waving and weeping had studiously turned their backs. The boatmen uttered despairing cries for assistance but the men at the bridge bent to their tasks with unwonted diligence. As far as they were concerned we had passed out of their lives. We might never have existed. </blockquote> And so it goes, even as Newby and his crew run aground 63 times in the first six days, or switch doggedly from boat to train to bullock cart and back to boat again. His patience in the face of continuous disaster is superbly entertaining, as are his attempts to mollify his increasingly impatient wife, Wanda. Still, his gift for the farcical slow burn never keeps him from relishing the terrain, or from recording it in lyrical yet laconic prose: "At about six the sky to the east became faintly red; then it began to flame and the moon was extinguished; clouds of unidentifiable birds flew high overhead; a jackal skulked along the far shore and, knowing itself watched, went up the bank and into the trees; mist rose from the wet grass on the islands on which the shisham trees stood, wrapped like precious objects in their bandages of dead grass." <i>Slowly down the Ganges</i> is packed with such time-lapse portraiture, along with plenty of casual wisdom about history, humanity, and (last but not least) conjugal life. It's one of those rare voyages we only wish were much, much slower. <i>--James Marcus</i>Eric Newby was born in London in 1919. In 1938, he joined the four-masted Finnish barque Moshulu as an apprentice and sailed in the last Grain Race from Australia to Europe, by way of Cape Horn. During World War II, he served in the Black Watch and the Special Boat Section. In 1942, he was captured and remained a prisoner-of-war until 1945. He subsequently married the girl who helped him to escape, and for the next fifty years, his wife Wanda was at his side on many adventures. After the war, he worked in the fashion business and book publishing but always travelled on a grand scale, sometimes as the Travel Editor for the Observer. He was made CBE in 1994 and was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award of the British Guild of Travel Writers in 2001.

(The United States during two family furloughs seemed as exotic as India.) Alter&#39;s outsider perspective provides many telling insights in his account of a remarkable boyhood.As a boy, Alter visited the Taj Mahal by moonlight, kept homing pigeons as pets, observed cremations along the Ganges and toured Himalayan valleys and peaks, speaking a mixture of Hindi and English. Born in 1956 to American Presbyterian missionaries in Mussoorie, an Indian resort town high in the Himalayas, he wistfully evokes his idyllic Indian youth in this graceful memoir. The missionary community, "like a small town in middle America?Winesburg, Ohio, transported to the Himalayas," was outwardly harmonious, but beneath the neighborly, pious facade it seethed with squabbles and controversies, he reports. Alter's sporadic boyhood travels in the U.S. with his parents (Ithaca, N.Y., in 1961-1962 and a crisscrossing adventure from Los Angeles to Princeton, N.J., in 1967-1968), where he felt "poor... cheated and deprived," led to his immersion in American pop culture, his atheism and his desire to become a writer. He left India for Wesleyan University in 1974. From India's cyclical rhythms and diverse cultures, he learned the potency of myth and metaphor, an experience beautifully distilled in a memoir that nonetheless remains rather detached from the wider Indian society. A writer-in-residence at MIT, Alter's novels include Neglected Lives. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>One Goal: A Coach, a Team, and the Game That Brought a Divided Town Together</h2><p><strong>In the tradition of <i>Friday Night Lights</i> and <i>Outcasts United</i>, ONE GOAL tells the inspiring story of the soccer team in a town bristling with racial tension that united Somali refugees and multi-generation Mainers in their quest for state--and ultimately national--glory.</strong><br><br>When thousands of Somali refugees resettled in Lewiston, Maine, a struggling, overwhelmingly white town, longtime residents grew uneasy.

The outbuildings, the barn...shoot, even the fences had a permanent lean like drunken sailors after a year at sea. He pulled up the collar of his coat against the biting January wind.</p> <p>What had he been thinking? What did a former saloon owner know about ranching, anyway?</p> <p>The only thing he could rightly claim to understand were the drunks he'd served whiskey to at the Lily of the West in Battle Creek, Texas, three miles away. A drunk wanted his whiskey straight from the bottle, his woman warm and willing, and a soft place to lay his head. Rand had no idea how to care for the cows he'd buy come spring. All the beasts seemed to do was eat, drink, and moo.</p> <p>Come to think of it...maybe cows and drunks were more alike than he thought.</p> <p>Yet despite his reservations, he wanted this ranch more than anything else in the world.</p> <p>This was his dream.</p> <p>His chance to prove to himself that he could be the kind of man Isaac Daffern, the rancher who'd raised him and his brothers, had wanted him to be. He needed to prove that he measured up, not only in his brothers' eyes, but in his own.</p> <p>If he failed, he would lose everything that mattered.</p> <p>A door banged. He glanced down the ramshackle porch in the direction of the sound. Must be the wind. Every door on the place needed work, refusing to stay fastened. Tall weeds littered the yard, and the sucker rod of the old windmill groaned and complained with each rise and fall, the sound amplifying the stark emptiness around him. He was unprepared for the overwhelming loneliness of this new life he'd chosen.</p> <p>Maybe diving into work would help. But not today. Making the ranch fit for living would have to wait for a warmer day.</p> <p>He swung to go back inside by the fire when he caught a flash of blue disappearing into what must've been an old bunkhouse.</p> <p>What in God's name?</p> <p>The tall grasses whispered in the stiff breeze and he heard the unmistakable sound of a door closing. The deliberate softness of that sound raised the hair on the back of his neck. Maybe he wasn't so alone out here after all. He reached for his Colt and stole forward. Between the building's slatted wood, he glimpsed movement.</p> <p>Rand took a deep breath and yanked open the door. "Whoever's in here had best come out."</p> <p>Soft scurrying provided no clue.</p> <p>Maybe he was mistaken and it was a small animal after all.</p> <p>But no animals he ever knew wore blue.</p> <p>A poacher? A thief? Most likely someone up to no good.</p> <p>Cautious, he stepped inside. Thick gloom closed around him and the dank air clogged his throat. Spiderwebs hung from the ceiling like torn gossamer fabric from a dance-hall girl's dress.</p> <p>And then he caught the faint whiff of some sort of scent. Flowers?</p> <p>"Anybody here?" Eyes were watching him. He renewed his grip on the Colt, readying for anything. "You're trespassing on private property. Come out. I won't hurt you."</p> <p>Three more steps, then four. As his eyes adjusted to the dimness, he saw two forms huddling in a far corner. When he got closer, a woman leaped to her feet, brandishing a stick that came within a hair of whacking his leg. Surprise rippled through him as he jumped back. He'd never expected a woman. She was shivering either from fear or the icy wind.</p> <p>"Please, I don't mean you any harm, ma'am. My name's Rand Sinclair, and I'm the new owner here." His gaze flicked to the second person, a young boy.</p> <p>The boy gave a sudden lunge, positioning himself in front of the woman with his arms extended. "Get back, mister. Leave us be. We ain't hurtin' nuthin'."</p> <p>Rand finally remembered the Colt and slid it back into the holster. "I know, son, but it's dangerous out here. Let's get inside out of this weather. From the looks of you, I reckon you're cold and tired and hungry."</p> <p>"We don't need you," the slip of a boy flung at him.</p> <p>"Maybe not. But seeing as this is my land, like it or not, right now you have me. I have a fire going, and food. I'll share it. You don't have to be afraid."</p> <p>"We always have to be afraid." The woman lowered the stick, though. "It's the only way to stay alive."</p> <p>That said it all. Clearly, she had trouble trailing her. He knew all too well what that was like.</p> <p>"Ma'am, can we eat?" the boy asked, his teeth chattering. He seemed to be relaxing his guard too.</p> <p>Rand said softly, "Think of your son if nothing else. He needs a warm fire and food. He'll get sick. You wouldn't want that. I won't hurt you. Please, I just want to help. I think you'd do the same for me if I were in your shoes. Out here we take care of each other."</p> <p>She took his measure with a hard stare. After several long seconds, she dropped the makeshift weapon and reached for her son's hand. Rand removed his coat and put it around her shoulders. He held the door, then led them toward the two-story frame house.</p> <p>As they walked, he viewed their condition out of the corner of his eye. The woman's torn, dirty blue dress. The youngster's grimy face and clothes. Yet the mysterious trespasser carried herself straight and tall like someone who was accustomed to a better life and who took pride in herself.</p> <p>Inside the warm kitchen, he put three sticks of wood into the cookstove and moved the skillet onto the fire. "I take it you've been traveling a ways. Where are you from?"</p> <p>"That's not important," the woman replied absently, taking off his coat. She stood looking around the room for several minutes, taking everything in.</p> <p>With his attention split between trying to watch her and cracking eggs, Rand discovered some had missed the bowl entirely and landed on the counter. He scooped them in with the others, then fished out several pieces of broken shell that were swimming amid the whites and yolks.</p> <p>When he glanced her way again, he found her running her fingers across the faded wallpaper.</p> <p>The boy sat at the table sniffling, and when he coughed, it came from deep inside. "We didn't steal nuthin', mister."</p> <p>"No one's saying you did, son. I can see you're not that kind. You have kin around here?" Rand asked the woman.</p> <p>She didn't answer. She stood lost in thought, staring at two sets of horizontal marks beside the door. Her spine straightened and she sucked in a breath as she touched the penciled-in measurements.</p> <p>Rand guessed she was remembering something that meant a lot to her. Unexpected memories could certainly jar a person. He wished he could say something to offer comfort, but nothing came to mind.</p> <p>"I'm not much of a cook," he rambled on. "This is only my second day at it. Surely I'll get better." He gave her an apologetic grin. "How long have you been in that old bunkhouse?"</p> <p>Her head snapped up. "You're full of questions, mister."</p> <p>"Sorry. A bad habit. My brothers always say that I should've been a census taker. I get on their nerves sometimes, especially my oldest brother's."</p> <p>With a sudden swoosh, flames erupted in the skillet.</p> <p>Before thinking, he grabbed the handle. The instant his hand came in contact with the heated metal, he pulled back with a yell. Searing pain radiated through his hand, every curse word he knew poised on his tongue, wanting to come out.</p> <p>Only a day and a half and he was already burning down his house.</p> <p>Quick as a flash, his mystery woman grabbed a flour sack as a mitt and carried the skillet of burning grease to the door, where she set it on the ground. Then she came and gently took his hand, dipping it into the pail of cold water he'd carried in that morning. The relief was welcome.</p> <p>"Thank you. Like I said, I'm a stranger to this." He met her stare and saw compassion in its depth, a far cry from the brittle anger that had been there just minutes ago. She wasn't as hard as she wanted him to believe.</p> <p>Her dark brown hair shot through with strands of scarlet was warm in the lamplight. But her soft amber eyes, the exact color of whiskey, revealed a deep-seated distrust and a whole lot of grit.</p> <p>"Do you have some salve, by chance?"</p> <p>"On the shelf above the stove. I never thought I'd need it this quick."</p> <p>"Sit at the table, and I'll doctor your hand."</p> <p>"You don't have to do that, but I appreciate your offer." He took a chair next to the boy, who had laid his head on his arms. The lad was clearly ill.</p> <p>Before she went for the salve, she felt the boy's forehead. Her frown told Rand his suspicions were true.</p> <p>"It would be best if he lies down," he said quietly. "At least until I get you something to eat. You'll find some quilts in front of the fireplace in the parlor."</p> <p>A gentle shake roused her son. "Come, Toby."</p> <p>Rand's gaze followed them to the parlor, which was visible through the doorway. Great love for her son shone in the way she tucked a quilt around him, then kissed his cheek. Rand was glad he'd persuaded them to come inside.</p> <p>Returning, the mother found the ointment and carefully spread it across the red welt on Rand's palm. He'd never known such a soothing, tender touch. As the owner of a saloon, he'd been touched by lots of women, but this was different. It almost felt like the feathery caress of a whisper. He closed his eyes for a moment, savoring the sensation.</p> <p>Finally, she put the lid on the salve, then tore a strip off the flour sack and wrapped it around his hand. "There, that should do it."</p> <p>"I owe you." He gave her a wry smile. "But I'm afraid it'll take me awhile to get you that breakfast I promised."</p> <p>"You sit here. I'll fix it." She rose and took another skillet from a shelf under the counter.</p> <p>He watched, amazed at her competence as she put a dollop of butter into the skillet, beat the eggs, cut thick slices of toast, and had it all ready before he knew what was happening. It astounded him how she seemed to know her way around the kitchen. Where he kept the skillets, the butter, the eggs. But he decided that most kitchens were pretty much laid out the same, and women instinctively knew where everything was.</p> <p>"I don't have milk for the boy. Haven't had time to get a milk cow."</p> <p>Her amber stare met his. "No need to apologize. I can't let him have it anyway. Fever will curdle milk."</p> <p>"I believe I might've heard that somewhere. Sorry." His gaze drifted to the mound of scrambled eggs on their plates. They sure looked fluffy and light, just like the caf� in Battle Creek made them. His mouth began to water even though he'd already eaten.</p> <p>It became more apparent that she had good breeding a few minutes later. She went to get the boy from the pile of quilts but wouldn't let him eat until they'd both bowed their heads and given thanks.</p> <p>Toby, she'd called him. The lad's fevered eyes lifted to Rand's. "Thank you, sir."</p> <p>"You're welcome, son." Rand swallowed a hard lump in his throat. The scrappy child reminded him of himself and his two brothers seventeen years ago. They'd had nothing and no one except for each other, were on the run for their lives, forced to trust strangers for survival.</p> <p>He poured himself a cup of coffee. "I would've made biscuits, only I don't know how. Me and cooking are like two snarling strangers, and I'm pretty sure I'm not going to win."</p> <p>She spoke low. "This is fine. It's filling. More than we had outside. You have no woman?"</p> <p>"No." And that's the way Rand wanted it. He would live alone the rest of his life. "What's your name, ma'am?"</p> <p>"It's not important. I deeply appreciate your kindness, but we won't be here long enough to socialize, mister."</p> <p>"Like I told you, I'm Rand Sinclair, not mister. And a name is always important...to someone."</p> <p>"Not anyone I know." She sighed. "It's Callie. That's all. Just Callie."</p> <p>"Glad to meet you, Callie."</p> <p>"I didn't know anyone lived here." She forked a bite of food into her mouth. "I'm not a poacher."</p> <p>"I guessed that," Rand said quietly. "You're welcome to stay as long as you want. But it's too cold out there. I can't in good conscience let you go back to that bunkhouse."</p> <p>Callie's chin raised a notch. "Then we'll move on."</p> <p>He couldn't let this woman and child risk it out there in the unforgiving Texas winter. His conscience would never forgive him. And he suspected he needed them as much as they needed him. This morning had already proved he might well starve if left on his own.</p> <p>An idea took root. "Wait a minute and hear me out first. I'm looking to hire a cook for me and a few ranch hands when I bring them on in a few months. I'd love for you to fill the job. If you're willing, I'll furnish room and board in exchange. You'd live off this kitchen." He walked to a door and opened it to show her the small bedroom that had not one single stick of furniture in it. "I know it isn't much, but it's warm."</p> <p>She lifted an eyebrow. "And you? Where would you sleep?"</p> <p>"Upstairs. You have nothing to fear from me. This kitchen would be your domain. You alone would rule it. I have some furniture ordered that will be here in a week or so. As I told you outside, I recently bought the place. It'll take time to fix it up and get it looking decent. Frankly, I could use the help."</p> <p>The boy coughed, the sound rattling from deep inside his thin chest. Concern darkened Callie's eyes. She tenderly smoothed back his hair.</p> <p>"Winter is supposed to be a bad one," Rand pressed.</p> <p>"I make no promises about how long Toby and I will stay."</p> <p>"Agreed."</p> <p>"And no one can know about us being here."</p> <p>"Can't promise that. I have two brothers, and they'll both be here helping me. The oldest, Cooper Thorne, is now the sheriff in Battle Creek. Brett Liberty is the youngest. I won't lie to them. But I can agree to not tell anyone else."</p> <p>"You swear?"</p> <p>"Yes. My word is my bond."</p> <p>"You're not to ask any questions."</p> <p>"Understood. Do we have a bargain, Miss Callie?"</p> <p>The lines in her face relaxed a bit. "Toby and I will stay. Just for a while."</p> <p>Why it meant so much to help them, Rand couldn't say. Maybe he simply wanted to pay forward Daffern's kindness to him. Yet when he and Callie struck the deal, it seemed to lift the dreariness of the gray gloom that had closed around him.</p> <p>What had seemed overwhelming before now appeared manageable. He would succeed. He had a strong back and hands that itched to carve out something he could be proud for others to see, even if those "others" were just the pair of strays he'd found.</p> <p>Rand allowed himself a slight smile for the first time that day. "Excellent. I'll go into town to round up a bed for you and anything else you think we might need."</p> <p>Though God only knew where he'd get the money. The thought of accepting help from the mother who'd recently come back into his life after twenty-some-odd years stuck in his craw. His relationship with her was...well, complicated. He didn't know yet if he could forgive her for leaving him in an orphanage.</p> <p>Still, the simple fact was, except for putting some money by for repairs and to buy cattle in the spring, he'd thrown everything he'd gotten from the sale of the saloon into this p...</p></p><h2>Month-By-Month Organic Gardening: The Green Gardener&#39;s Calendar</h2><p>Hills, Lawrence D., Month-By-Month Organic Gardening: The Green Gardener&#39;s Calendar</p><p></p><h2>Fear the Darkness: A Novel (Brigid Quinn Series)</h2><p><p><b>Finalist for the New Mexico/Arizona Book Award</b></p><p><i>It's hard to recognize the devil when his hand is on your shoulder.

Kennedy and replete with many never-before-seen photographs, this posthumous memoir draws on previously unpublished oral histories, gallery talks, and speeches by Jacques Lowe, JFK&#x2019;s official photographer. Jacques Lowe was the official photographer of John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s pivotal 1960 campaign for the presidency as well as his personal photographer following his election, with unprecedented access to the President&#x2019;s family and inner circle. Fifty years after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, it is finally possible to publish Lowe&#x2019;s own, never-before-revealed account of his experiences during the Camelot years, supplemented with previously unseen material from his private files, the Kennedy Archives, and a range of other sources. In both words and pictures, Lowe captures the charisma of Kennedy relaxing at home with Jackie and daughter Caroline, engaging with the public on the campaign trail, at work in the White House, and as a leader on the world stage. These photographs are an astonishing record of an era when political image-making was far less calculated than it is today. Lowe&#x2019;s 40,000 negatives of the Kennedy years were stored in the vaults of the World Trade Center. After 9/11&#x2014;which came just months after Lowe&#x2019;s death&#x2014;it was learned that this priceless collection had been reduced to ashes, leaving Lowe&#x2019;s original contact sheets as the only record of a most remarkable era.</p><p>Jacques Lowe (1930&#x2013;2001) was John F.

From the explosions of image and color in In The Shadow of the Sun, The Last of England, The Garden and Wittgenstein, to the somber blacks of his collages and tar paintings, Jarman has consistently used color in unprecedented ways, making his ideas on the subject of interest to filmmakers, film audiences, artists and students alike. Blue, his most personal and innovative film, consists of a compelling soundtrack accompanied by a monochrome blue image and is, among other things, a comment on Jarman's diminishing eyesight due to AIDS.<br>In his signature style, a lyrical combination of classical theory, anecdote, and poetry, Jarman takes the reader through the spectrum, introducing each color as an embodiment of an emotion, evoking memories or dreams. He explains the use of color in Medieval painting through the Renaissance to the modernists and draws on the great color theorists from Pliny to Leonardo. He writes too about the meanings of color in literature, science, philosophy, psychology, religion and alchemy. Read either as a work on color, or a distillation of Jarman's artistic vision, Chroma presents an exciting perspective on the subject.</p><p>Derek Jarman&#39;s creativity spanned decades and genres - painter, theatre designer, director, film maker, writer and gardener. From his first one-man show at the Lisson Gallery in 1969; set designs and costumes for the theatre and ballet; production design for Ken Russell&#39;s films The Devils and Savage Messiah; through his own films in super-8; features such as Sebastine (1976), The Tempest (1979), Caravaggio (1986), The Last of England (1987) and Edward II (1991); to directing pop-videos and live performances for Pet Shop Boys and Suede. His paintings - for which he was a Turner Prize nominee in 1986 - have been exhibited world-wide. His publications include: Dancing Ledge, Kicking the Pricks, Modern Nature, At Your Own Risk and Derek Jarman&#39;s Garden. Jarman died in 1994 of an AIDS-related illness, aged 52. His garden surrounding the fisherman&#39;s cottage in Dungeness where he spent the last years of his life remains a site of awe and pilgrimage for fans and newcomers to Jarman&#39;s singular vision.England's brashest independent filmmaker (Edward II, Wittgenstein), Jarman, who died of AIDS last February, draws on personal anecdote, literature and the work of Wittgenstein, Leonardo, Pliny and Kandinsky in this sketchy and highly idiosyncratic series of meditations on color. Focusing chapters on individual colors or on qualities like iridescence, Jarman moves freely from one passage, be it a quotation from Isaac Newton or a nursery rhyme, to another: a memory of his aloof father, a list of prices for brands of white oil paint. Jarman's pictorially lush films are vivid testimony to his sensitivity to the subject, but the fragments assembled here are not consistently informative or eloquent enough to reward any but the most ardent fans of the filmmaker. <p></p><p>Copyright 1995 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Someday My Prince</h2><p><p>The Princess Must Marry</p><p>Princess Laurentia leads a fairy-tale life, attending glittering balls and wearing beautiful gowns.

Her first marriage was a nightmare, and she's not anxious to repeat the experience, but she must marry and produce an heir to the throne. King Jerome adores his daughter and summons suitors from far and near to compete for her hand, determined that she shall marry for love to a man worthy of her. Neither Laurentia nor the King could have anticipated that the man who would make her heart sing would be Dominic of Baminia, the mercenary and bastard brother of the king of neighboring Sereminia. Laurentia fights Dominic's overwhelming sensual pull, for he's much too handsome and she has cause to distrust handsome, powerful men. Meanwhile, Dominic has a dark agenda that honor insists he fulfill, but despite his better sense, he finds himself falling in love with the petite, courageous Princess. Will Laurentia be able to forgive Dom's betrayal? Will Dom discover before it's too late that it's love and not just lust that he feels for the Princess? <p> In this sequel to <i>The Runaway Princess</i>, Dodd pairs a hard-edged, handsome mercenary with a lovely, wise princess and makes the match not only believable but also completely enjoyable.

Compassion has a theological meaning. In this book, Andrew Purves sees compassion as the center of pastoral care, holding theology, spirituality, and ministry together.

Blunt and matter-of-fact (the less charitable might say cold and calculating), he has perfected the art of theft. Unfortunately, perfection can be a relative term, a concept made vulnerable by the honor--or lack thereof--among thieves. When Parker joins forces with three other crooks to rob a Nebraska bank, he's prepared for a gentlemanly division of the proceeds, not for a double-cross. But his colleagues have other plans for his share: it will be their seed money for a $12 million Palm Beach jewel heist. What's Parker to do but make his own plans to steal the Palm Beach loot from the double- crossers?<p> Working his way across the Southeast in a series of carefully executed robberies and changes of identity, Parker arrives in Palm Beach, where he finds more barriers along the path of revenge than he could have imagined. Chief among them: a diabolically clever plan by his former partners; a real estate agent named Leslie with an unfortunately sharp sense of character; and a team of professional hit men out for Parker's blood (but why?). </p><p> In his third outing after a long retirement by Stark (the pen name of Donald E.

For instance, here she was, at five-thirty this Thursday afternoon, in her chauffeured Daimler, with her new husband, the delicious Jack, to pick up just the <i>perfect</i> jewelry for tonight's pre-auction ball, and she knew when she arrived at the bank she would be surrounded by her own kind, chauffeured and cosseted women with attractive escorts, all coming to the bank (the only bank one could use, really) because this particular bank stayed open late whenever there was an important ball in town, just so the herd could come get its jewelry out of the safe-deposit boxes.</blockquote> Not to be missed by fans of gritty noir, nor by those who prefer their crime cocktails with a comic twist: Stark and Parker will give you both. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i>5 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Nellie Taft: The Unconventional First Lady of the Ragtime Era</h2><p><p>From critically acclaimed presidential-family historian <strong>Carl Sferrazza Anthony</strong> comes the first biography of Helen Herron Taft, the unconventional wife of the twenty-seventh President of the United States who, in an era before Eleanor Roosevelt, was overt about her power and saw to it that her husband both aspired to, and won, the highest office in the land.</p><p>On the morning of William Howard Taft's inauguration, Nellie Taft publicly expressed that theirs would be a joint administration by shattering precedent and demanding that she ride alongside her husband down Pennsylvania Avenue, a seat previously held for the outgoing President. In addition to her passion for entertaining, this progressive First Lady was an advocate for higher education and partial suffrage for women, initiated legislation to improve working conditions for federal employees, and created Washington's famous grove of blossoming cherry trees. She smoked, drank, and gambled without regard to societal judgment. During Taft's time as the governor general of the Philippines, she broke racial and class boundaries. Nellie Taft's fate was ultimately bound to larger events, including the Titanic sinking and Teddy Roosevelt's creation of the Bull Moose Party.</p><p>Drawn from previously unpublished diaries, a lifetime of love letters between Will and Nellie, and detailed family correspondence and recollections, Anthony develops a riveting portrait of Nellie Taft as one of the strongest links in the series of women -- from Abigail Adams to Hillary Rodham Clinton -- often critically declared "co-Presidents."</p></p><p><p><strong>Carl Sferrazza Anthony</strong>, the author of nine books, is considered the nation's expert on the subject of presidential wives and families. He has written extensively for publications, including the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, <em>Washington Post</em>, <em>Vanity Fair</em>, <em>American Heritage</em>, <em>Smithsonian</em>, and <em>Town &amp; Country</em>, and also writes screenplays. He currently lives in Los Angeles.</p>Anthony (<i>First Ladies</i>;<i> Florence Harding;</i> etc.) takes on one of the least compelling First Ladies and does his best to make her colorful. Helen "Nellie" Herron Taft (1861&#x2013;1943) went through life underwhelmed by power, having visited the White House for the first time at age 17. Despite Anthony's occasional attempts to make Nellie out to be a revolutionary ragtime heroine of women's rights and a precursor of such policy-driven first ladies as Eleanor Roosevelt and Hillary Clinton, Nellie seems, on the facts, to have been a typical wife of her time and a devoted mother to her three children. Yet, as Anthony shows, the one area where she was decidedly strong was in her always shrewd and sometimes shrill advocacy for her husband and his interests (think Nancy Reagan). Nellie's other attributes&#x2014;such as her skill at fashioning elaborate White House balls&#x2014;may be less remarkable to readers. The best part of his narrative concerns the year 1909&#x2013;1910, when Nellie struggled successfully to come back from a debilitating stroke, continuing to run the household with the help of a daughter retrieved from college. Anthony is also adept at portraying the complex, calculated bitterness with which Nellie greeted TR's 1912 attempt to usurp his onetime golden boy, Taft, when TR mounted a third-party challenge that toppled him. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos not seen by <i>PW</i>. <i>Agent, Lisa Bankoff.</i><i>(Apr. 12)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Evidence of Choctaw women's participation in religious and political concerns, however, declined drastically early in the eighteenth century. Michelene Pesantubbee traces the changes in women's roles in Choctaw society from the late 1600s to the mid-1700s during the French colonial period in the Lower Mississippi Valley.</p><p>Before the arrival of the French explorers, Choctaw women could earn recognition as "beloved," an esteemed designation that indicated sacred status. Pesantubbee relates the decline of women's status to the religious, economic, and military interests of the French colonial church and state. She focuses on the increased violence in the Southeast, the demise of the Green Corn ceremony, and the declining importance of the symbol of Corn Woman to explain changes in women's roles.</p><p>Pesantubbee draws on oral history, religious practices, archaeology, mythology, and documentary sources to expand our understanding of the concept of "beloved woman." She examines the women's roles in Choctaw funeral traditions well into the nineteenth century as an example of the ways in which women continued to carry out beloved functions in the face of drastic changes in gender roles.</p><p>As a Choctaw woman, Pesantubbee is especially sensitive to the absence of women from many tribal histories. By offering new ways to view this facet of Choctaw society, she provides insight into the dynamics of simultaneous change and continuity in a relatively short period of time.</p></p><p>Michelene Pesantubbee explores the changing roles of Choctaw women from pre-European contact to the twentieth century.Michelene E.

We&#x2019;re handicapped not only by psychological biases and a fear of missing out, but by an industry with multimillion-dollar marketing budgets and an eye on its own bottom line, not yours. <br>&nbsp;<br>Unless you&#x2019;re very handy, you probably don&#x2019;t know how to fix your own car or give a family member a decent haircut. But most Americans are expected to be part-time fund managers. With a steady, livable pension check becoming a rarity, we&#x2019;ve been entrusted with our own finances and, for the most part, failed miserably. <br>&nbsp;<br>Since leaving his job as a top-rated stock ana�lyst to become an investing columnist, Jakab has watched his readers&#x2014;and his family, friends, and colleagues&#x2014;make the same mistakes again and again. He set out to evaluate the typical advice people get, from the clearly risky to the seemingly safe, to figure out where it all goes wrong and how they could do much better. <br>Blending entertaining stories with some sur�prising research, Jakab explains <br>&nbsp;<br>�How a typical saver could have a retirement nest egg twice as large by being cheap and lazy. <br>�Why investors who put their savings with a high-performing mutual fund manager end up worse off than if they&#x2019;d picked one who has struggled. <br>�The best way to cash in on your hunch that a recession is looming. <br>�How people who check their brokerage accounts frequently end up falling behind the market. <br>�Who isn&#x2019;t nearly as good at investing as the media would have you think. <br>&nbsp;<br>He also explains why you should never trust a World Cup&#x2013;predicting octopus, why you shouldn&#x2019;t invest in companies with an X or a Z in their names, and what to do if a time traveler offers you eco�nomic news from the future. <br>&nbsp;<br>Whatever your level of expertise, <i>Heads I Win, Tails I Win </i>can help you vastly improve your odds of investment success.</p><p><p><b>SPENCER JAKAB</b> writes for and edits the &#x201c;Heard on the Street&#x201d; col�umn for <i>The Wall Street Journal </i>and previously wrote its daily investing column, &#x201c;Ahead of the Tape.&#x201d; He has also written about investing for the <i>Financial Times, Barron&#x2019;s</i>, and Dow Jones News�wires. Prior to becoming a journalist, he was a top-rated stock analyst covering emerging markets at Credit Suisse. This is his first book.</p>Chapter One<br><br> Lake Moneybegone<br><br> If I can tell you where you got your shoes at, can I give you a shoeshine?"<br><br> It was near the peak of the technology boom and business had never been better for the investment bank where I was working. Naturally, the director of our research department did what many executives in highly cyclical industries do when their companies are minting money: He decided to spend it like a drunken sailor. The company flew more than a hundred analysts from various countries in Europe and the Middle East by business class all the way to New Orleans for a long weekend full of speeches and "team-building" exercises.<br><br> A lot of what happened that weekend is unprintable, and some of it is a little hard to remember. Still, despite acting like drunken sailors ourselves, we learned a few things. One of my inebriated colleagues, for example, discovered that in America, unlike England, police cars and taxis look really similar. We bailed him out the next morning, but weren't around to lend a helping hand to another Brit who took the toothless, elderly African American man up on his offer to identify where he bought his shoes. He certainly wasn't going to guess Marks &amp; Spencer, was he?<br><br> "You got your shoes right here on Bourbon Street!"<br><br> A good sport and not about to be a pedant about the Queen's English or a dangling preposition, he chuckled and sat down for his shoeshine while the rest of the group kept walking toward the bar. When he was done, the man, not having mentioned the price ahead of time, asked for $25. Whether today or sixteen years ago, that's a lot of money for a bit of spit and polish. But as my colleague began to object, five very large men suddenly materialized and made sure he paid in full.<br><br> I love making bets, and I especially love winning them, though I've never relied on linguistic ambiguity, much less the threat of violence, to do so. One way to avoid being the patsy in a wager is to consider how much information the other person has compared to you, and another is to recognize when one of you is being overconfident. Here's a case when those two would cancel each other out. Say I were to bet every person reading this who said they were above average at investing (studies show most of you would claim to be) to benchmark your returns in the same way that people do for their looks or driving ability. The latter two are pretty hard to quantify, but portfolio performance isn't. Many of you wouldn't take me up on it, so it might seem like I'd be setting myself up for a fall by betting against a self-selected group-only the cr�me de la cr�me, as it were.<br><br> Except I wouldn't be. Studies, among them one by German finance professors Markus Glaser and Martin Weber, show that there's absolutely no connection between how well an investor actually has done and how well they think they have done. None, nada, zip. Or, as the Herren Professors put it in more scientific language (ideally recited in a thick Teutonic accent), "The correlation coefficient between return estimates and realized returns is not distinguishable from zero."<br><br> That's pretty amazing. But if I wanted to do better than just break even-much better, in fact-I'd bet you instead on whether or not you keep up with the market return. In Glaser and Weber's study the investors surveyed estimated that on average they had made nearly 15 percent on an annualized basis over the four years in question. Their average performance actually was just 3.7 percent, and only about two out of ten managed to keep pace with the overall market.<br><br> Another much longer-term study of U.S. investors is even starker. In April 2015, Dalbar, a firm that evaluates fund managers, released results on how American investors in mutual funds did over the past thirty years compared to the markets that those funds were supposed to track. As I said in the preface, people unfamiliar with these numbers often scoff in disbelief. A handful of other researchers have attempted to calculate this "performance gap" and come up with numbers in the same ballpark. So read them and weep:<br><br> The "composite fund investor" earned an annualized 2.5 percent during those 30 years. That is just awful. It's less than inflation during that time. In other words, if a typical saver had a nice nest egg at the end of 30 years it was only because he or she salted away lots of his or her paychecks, not as the result of any real investment gains. And of course this is all before taxes.<br><br> Over the same time frame, the main U.S. stock index, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, earned just over 11 percent a year, and the broadest bond index, the Barclays Aggregate, managed 7.4 percent. Trailing the market in a single year or even for a few years is nothing to panic about, but three decades is an entirely different matter. That great boon to your nest egg, compound interest, works insidiously in reverse too. Fear, greed, na�vet�, bad advice, and even the cost of sound advice combine to whittle away the pot of money we should earn after a lifetime of saving relative to what we could have amassed.<br><br> Add up the effect of all this behavior and you wind up somewhere I call Lake Moneybegone. Like Garrison Keillor's fictional town of Lake Wobegon where all the children are above average, nearly all investors are below average, and not by a little. But while that sounds bad, a gap expressed in percentage points is just too abstract to resonate with a typical saver.<br><br> "You really have to tell them that they should be shocked," says Dalbar's founder, Lou Harvey. "They really need to translate that into 'can you put your kids through college, can you fund your retirement?'"<br><br> The sums left on the table really are shocking. To consider a simplified example, let's say your great-uncle leaves you a $100,000 inheritance at age thirty-five but doesn't entirely trust your judgment. He forbids you to touch the principal or change how it's invested until you retire at age sixty-five. Being a frugal and conservative sort, he picks low-cost index funds comprised of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds and they rebalance back to those percentages at the start of each year. Now, let's say your best friend receives a similar gift but is free to invest it as she sees fit, though also without withdrawing any principal. Your friend is a typical investor.<br><br> Fast-forward to the day thirty years later when you both qualify for Medicare and your great-uncle's gift would be worth over $1.5 million before taxes-seven times the $215,000 your friend has accumulated. That seems like it should be mathematically impossible. How can an average investor be so far below the passive return of the market? Where does all the money she didn't earn wind up?<br><br> Like I said before, not money heaven. That foregone income is earned by someone else. While the children in Keillor's fictional town can't really all be above average, there's no reason why the vast majority of investors can't be below it. That's because "average" and "market average" aren't the same thing. Subtract the costs of investing from all the wealth that stocks, bonds, and other investments churn out and you have what investors earned on average, but not what an average investor earned.<br><br> The gap of several percentage points between that typical investor's return and what the market as a whole generates each year has to wind up somewhere. Multiply that shortfall by the $23 trillion or so that Americans have stashed in retirement accounts and you begin to understand that the eye-popping compensation on Wall Street isn't conjured out of thin air. They at least owe you a thank-you card.<br><br> As financial types put it, investing is a zero-sum game. I compare it to a poker room in a casino where players' money gets redistributed. There's a reason I'm not using the example of a friendly neighborhood game of five-card stud. Unlike your buddy's basement, the casino is a business and takes a "rake," or a small cut, of every pot in order to pay the dealer, its overhead, and of course earn a profit. It's a slow but, over time, not insignificant drag on each player's returns that's analogous to the financial services industry's middleman role.<br><br> Calling costs "death by a thousand cuts" is a little too dramatic, but the slow bleed can do a surprising amount of harm. A typical saver spends something like $170,000 in fees by the time they retire and gives up a fifth of their potential return. Can you imagine how people would react if, instead of paying that amount little by little and having to read about it in tiny letters buried in a quarterly statement most of us glance at briefly, we got presented with a bill for $170,000 at age sixty-five? It would make my colleague's shock at the $25 shoeshine pale in comparison. But pay it you do.<br><br> For most investors, that isn't even the biggest impediment to keeping up with the market. Much like any poker game by the end of the evening, the chips from investing are redistributed in a very uneven way that winds up costing you more. You, the reader, are like the guy who has to keep checking his little card to see if a straight beats a flush and walks home shaking his head and vowing to get 'em next time. For typical stock fund investors alone, Dalbar calculates that poor timing-zigging when we should zag-costs a typical investor almost two percentage points a year. That's nearly twice what we lose to fees and adds up to hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime of saving. Yeah, really.<br><br> You can choose to be upset about that or you can look at it constructively. What sort of world would you rather live in-one in which nearly everyone earned a 3 percent return on their money and the average market return was also 3 percent, or one where most people earned 3 percent but the average return was 7 percent?<br><br> Unless you're racked by envy, that's a no-brainer. In the 3 percent return world you'd have to be especially clever and active to earn something like 7 percent, perhaps doing so with the help of an expensive "expert" who would pocket some of that additional return and almost certainly by taking more risk. But in the real world the gap between 7 percent and 3 percent is a result of all the things you thought would get you ahead and backfired instead.<br><br> There are few failures in life as significant, surprising, or persistent as that of the average investor who always seems to be running as fast as he can in the wrong direction. The residents of Lake Moneybegone do all sorts of supposedly smart things, take unnecessary and poorly understood risks, pay princely sums to allegedly clever people, and, instead of earning a decent passive return that can build a modest amount of savings during a working life into a respectable nest egg, wind up with a lot less. That's why I say there's a silver lining to the grossly uneven distribution of investment returns. The money you should and could be earning is out there, and a big part of grabbing more of it involves being cheap and lazy. It's really a wonder that I'm not as rich as Rockefeller.<br><br> In all seriousness, though, if I do my job properly then I'll have convinced you by the time you finish reading this book that less is more when it comes to investing. Framing investing choices in terms of odds, I'll demonstrate that many of the actions we take in the belief that they'll give us an edge do the precise opposite. And even if we think we can earn a market return or something close to it, we do a poor job of estimating the very wide range of possible outcomes for our nest egg. If you have a realistic idea of what to expect, you can be prepared instead of getting blindsided. Hope is not a strategy.<br><br> You'll also see that other things you perceive as risky or even foolhardy can increase your odds of earning a solid, long-run return. Sticking our necks out is hard for many of us at the best of times and especially so during turbulent ones, but doing so allows investors to turn the market's lemons into lemonade.<br><br> On the other hand, many risks are unnecessary or even hidden. There are funds, products, and investment practices that tantalize us with the prospect of something for nothing. Please understand that there are no free lunches. Fortunately, though, there are some cheap lunches, and these, oddly, are less popular than inferior strategies that have patrons lining up around the block. A handful of proven techniques and principles have allowed savvy investors to eke out a bit of extra return above what "the market" has produced. Many require a fair bit of patience and sometimes even professional guidance.<br><br> Finally, I'll explain why the best kind of expert to follow is almost always the cheapest one. Don't take that to an extreme, though. For some people, either because of their temperament or the fact that investing intimidates them, failing to find wise counsel is penny wise and pound foolish.<br><br> Before I start doling out advice, you should get a better idea of what sort of investor you are. That's a two-part question: financial and emotional. Let's tackle the numbers first.<br><br> I don't know you, so I can't say for certain that you live in Lake Moneybegone and, if you do, whether it's the rough part of town or the posh side. As Glaser and Weber showed, you probably don't know either. Look back carefully at your own financial history and get at least an approximate idea of how you've been doing and how much you've been paying in fees, commissions, and the like. Leave taxes out of it for now. These calculations aren't rocket science, but they can get complicated.<br><br> Just ask the Beardstown Ladies. The mathematically challenged women from a small town in Illinois rose to national fame following their investment club's annualized return of 23 percent during America's late 1990s infatuation with stocks. They doled out both financial advice and cooking tips and the public ate it up.

Wright, whom we know as a poet of exquisite miniatures, opens <i>God&#x2019;s Silence</i> with &#x201c;East Boston, 1996,&#x201d; a powerful long poem that looks back at the darker moments in the formation of his sensibility. He shares his private rules for bus riding (&#x201c;No eye contact: the eyes of the terrified / terrify&#x201d;), and recalls, among other experiences, his first encounter with a shotgun, as an eight-year-old boy (&#x201c;In a clearing in the cornstalks . . . it was suggested / that I fire / on that muttering family of crows&#x201d;). Throughout this volume, Wright continues his penetrating study of his own and our collective soul. He reaches a new level of acceptance as he intones the paradox &#x201c;I have heard God&#x2019;s silence like the sun,&#x201d; and marvels at our presumptions:<br><br>We speak of Heaven who have not yet accomplished<br>even this, the holiness of things <br>precisely as they are, and never will!<br><br>Though Wright often seeks forgiveness in these poems, his black wit and self-deprecation are reliably present, and he delights in reminding us that &#x201c;literature will lose, sunlight will win, don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201d;<br>But in this book, literature wins as well. <i>God&#x2019;s Silence </i>is a deeply felt celebration of what poetry (and its silences) can do for us.</p><p>Franz Wright was born in Vienna in 1953 and grew up in the Northwest, the Midwest, and Northern California. His most recent works include <i>Ill Lit: Selected &amp; New Poems</i>, <i>The Beforelife</i> (a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize), and <i>Walking to Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard</i> (which won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry). He has been the recipient of two National Endowment for the Arts grants, a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Whiting Fellowship, and the PEN/Voelcker Prize, among other honors. He lives in Waltham, Massachusetts, with his wife, the translator and writer Elizabeth Oehlkers Wright.Woods Hole Ferry<br> Crossing briefly this mirrory still Galilean blue water to the heaven<br><br> of the affluent, the users-up, unconsciously remote<br><br> from knowing themselves<br><br> our owners and starvers, occupying<br><br> as they always have, to no purpose,<br><br> the mansions and the beauty of the earth<br><br> for this short while<br><br> before<br><br> we all meet and enter at the same door.</p><h2>The Wipers Times: The Complete Series of the Famous Wartime Trench Newspaper</h2><p>In February 1916, Captain F.

His childhood was spent on a fruit farm near Mackinaw, Illinois. When he was twelve, Joseph was discovered by Russel Harvey, a teacher at Illinois Wesleyan University with whom he studied violin. There were very few guitar teachers at the time Mr. Castle became interested in the guitar, so he was primarily self-taught on that instrument, using the Carcassi text. His interest in both plectrum and fingerstyle guitar started in high school. He played guitar and violin in large bands in Austin, Texas as well as violin in the Austin symphony and small chamber groups. <p>Joseph graduated from the University of Texas in 1953 with a Bachelor of Music degree, majoring in violin and minoring in piano. From 1951 to 1953 he was concertmaster of the University Symphony Orchestra. He taught with the University of Texas String Project from 1952 to 1953. Joseph later returned to Austin, Texas, to devote his time to the classic guitar by teaching and making arrangements of solo and group guitar pieces. In 1960 his first collection of pieces for plectrum guitar ensemble was published by Mel Bay Publications, Inc. Mr. Castle edited and arranged books for clssic guitar, violin, and piano for many years for Mel Bay Publications. </p><p>In 1987, Joseph Castle was accepted into the Manuscript Archives Collection of the Fine Arts Division of the Dallas Public Lubrary. He donated the manuscript of this "Elegie for Strings" to the archives, which was one of two of his pieces performed in the Triennial Festival of Texas Composers. </p><p>In addition to his teaching and composing activities, Castle tuned pianos for many years. He was interested in the historical temparaments for tuning. </p><p>Joseph's musical activities included teaching in the string program of the public schools in Wichita Falls, Texas; professional string playing in the Castle trio and Castle String Quartet; Concertmaster, Autin Civic Orchestra; Classic guitar teacher, performer, and music editor. His "Suite in Spanish Style" for Alto Recorder or Flute and Classic Guitar was published by Loux Music in 1992. In 1991 he comleted a quartet for two recorders, viola da gamba, and classic guitar.</p></p><h2>Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust Holocaust And The David Irving Trial</h2><p>In ruling against the controversial historian David Irving in his libel suit against the American historian Deborah Lipstadt, last April 2000, the High Court in London labeled him a falsifier of history. No objective historian, declared the judge, would manipulate the documentary record in the way that Irving did. Richard J. Evans, a Cambridge historian and the chief advisor for the defense, uses this pivotal trial as a lens for exploring a range of difficult questions about the nature of the historian's enterprise. For instance, don't all historians in the end bring a subjective agenda to bear on their reading of the evidence? Is it possible that Irving lost his case not because of his biased history but because his agenda was unacceptable? The central issue in the trial&#x2014;as for Evans in this book&#x2014;was not the past itself, but the way in which historians study the past. In a series of short, sharp chapters, Richard Evans sets David Irving's methods alongside the historical record in order to illuminate the difference between responsible and irresponsible history. The result is a cogent and deeply informed study in the nature of historical interpretation.</p><p>Richard J. Evans is Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University and a noted specialist on modern German history. He is the author of Death in Hamburg and, more recently, In Defense of History.When Deborah Lipstadt's <i>Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory</i> (1993), a groundbreaking book about the disturbing movement to refute the reality of the Holocaust, was published, one of the writers identified as a Holocaust denier, the Englishman David Irving, sued Lipstadt and her publisher, Penguin, for libel. Although Irving never earned a degree, he has written nearly 30 books about Hitler and other related subjects. His contention, therefore, was that Lipstadt had denigrated his work as a historian by accusing him of distorting the historical record to support his extreme anti-Semitic politics. The defense had to prove that Irving, in fact, had deliberately misrepresented the contents of relevant documents to conform to his sympathetic view of Hitler and his belief that nothing on the order of genocide occurred under Nazi rule. Evans, a Cambridge-based historian who specializes in modern German history, was retained by the defense as an expert witness, and he chronicles his arduous research effort with impressive lucidity. At question was the very bedrock of history: Is there such a thing as historical objectivity? Or, as Evans writes, "How do we know when a historian is telling the truth? . . . Wasn't it all a matter of interpretation?" Sensitive to these conundrums and the high emotional valence attached to the Holocaust, Evans was scrupulous in his examination of thousands of pages of documents, assiduously evaluating Irving's interpretation of such primary sources as Goebbels' diaries, always on the lookout for evidence of inaccuracies and bias. He found plenty, and he describes his discoveries with quiet and contagious excitement. By sharing his vast insider's knowledge and recounting his surreal experiences on the stand as Irving, who represented himself, conducted his chaotic cross-examinations, Evans enables readers to fully appreciate the significance of both Lipstadt's victory and Irving's exposure as exactly what he claimed not to be. There is such a thing as truth, and history, responsibly practiced, will reveal it. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Worldly cares and self-serving desires begin to lose their appeal as Chambers aides the reader in transforming his mind by viewing life through the instruction of God's Word. Richard Halverson, former chaplain of the United States Senate, attests to this: "no book except the Bible has influenced my walk with Christ at such deep maturing levels."

It may take all her witchy intuition to find out.</p><p><b>Madelyn Alt</b> is the author of the Bewitching Mysteries. A born aficionado of all things paranormal, she currently spends her days toiling away in the mundane world of business and her nights writing tales of the mysterious. She loves chocolate, Siamese cats, a shivering-good ghost story, the magic in the world around us, and, sometimes, more chocolate.Alt is in no hurry to get to the bloodshed in her mild sixth paranormal mystery featuring Stony Mill, Ind., psychic empath Maggie O'Neil, Alt's first in hardcover (after 2009's <i>Where There's a Witch</i>). When Maggie's sister, Melanie, goes into labor, Maggie rushes to the hospital. En route to the delivery floor, Maggie gets stuck in an elevator, where she overhears an ominous conversation between two men (It's in the bag. No way she'll ever suspect. Not until it's too late). Maggie later breaks her foot after missing a step on the hospital stairway, offering an opportunity for her hunky wizard boyfriend, Marcus Quinn, to invite her to stay with him while she mends. Plenty of make-out scenes pass between Maggie and Marcus before a corpse turns up. The explanation for the suggestive dialogue she heard will strike many as a letdown. Those expecting only a simple puzzle tacked on to the heroine's continuing quest for romantic fulfillment will be satisfied. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Like many of the original stories themselves, these retellings are often dark, and many contain erotic subtexts. While some of the authors choose to stick to the more traditional aspects of folklore, others reinvent their tales entirely, such as the seven dwarfs who turn into "Three Dwarfs and 2000 Maniacs" at the hands of author Don Webb. As usual, Datlow and Windling have managed to enlist an impressive roster of professional writers for their project, with headliners such as Joyce Carol Oates, John Crowley, and Jane Yolen. These seasoned veterans are mixed in with some relative newcomers to create a collection that is as diverse as it is unique. <i>--Craig E.

One critic, writing upon the publication of the final volume, casually tagged the series as the ultimate work on Dostoevsky "in any language, and quite possibly forever."</p><p> Frank himself had not originally intended to undertake such a massive work. The endeavor began in the early 1960s as an exploration of Dostoevsky's fiction, but it later became apparent to Frank that a deeper appreciation of the fiction would require a more ambitious engagement with the writer's life, directly caught up as Dostoevsky was with the cultural and political movements of mid- and late-nineteenth-century Russia. Already in his forties, Frank undertook to learn Russian and embarked on what would become a five-volume work comprising more than 2,500 pages. The result is an intellectual history of nineteenth-century Russia, with Dostoevsky's mind as a refracting prism.</p><p>The volumes have won numerous prizes, among them the National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography, the Christian Gauss Award of Phi Beta Kappa, the <i>Los Angeles Times Book Prize</i>, and the James Russell Lowell Prize of the Modern Language Association.</p></p><p>The present is the first in a series devoted to the life and works of Dostoevsky.

However the discomfiture of the small round man in the faded red waistcoat is not entirely due to the sun. Dire portents plague his nights and haunt the city&#x2019;s streets like fiends of shadow. Assassins still skulk in alleyways, but the hunters have become the hunted. Hidden hands pluck the strings of tyranny like a fell chorus, and strangers have arrived. While the bards sing their tragic tales, somewhere in the distance can be heard the baying of hounds. All is palpably not well. And in Black Coral, where Anomander Rake, Son of Darkness rules, memories of ancient crimes are stirring, intent on revenge.

His first fantasy novel, the critically acclaimed bestseller, <b>Gardens of the Moon</b>, marked the opening chapter in the epic sequence <b>The Malazan Book of the Fallen.</b><br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Chapter One <p></p><b>S</b>urrounded in a city of blue fire, she stood alone on the balcony. The sky's darkness was pushed away, an unwelcome guest on this the first night of the Gedderone Fete. Throngs filled the streets of Darujhistan, happily riotous, good- natured in the calamity of one year's ending and another's beginning. The night air was humid and pungent with countless scents. <p></p>There had been banquets. There had been unveilings of eligible young men and maidens. Tables laden with exotic foods, ladies wrapped in silks, men and women in preposterous uniforms all glittering gilt - a city with no standing army bred a plethora of private militias and a chaotic proliferation of high ranks held, more or less exclusively, by the nobility. <p></p>Among the celebrations she had attended this evening, on the arm of her husband, she had not once seen a real officer of Darujhistan's City Watch, not one genuine soldier with a dusty cloak- hem, with polished boots bearing scars, with a sword- grip of plain leather and a pommel gouged and burnished by wear. Yet she had seen, bound high on soft, well- fed arms, torcs in the manner of decorated soldiers among the Malazan army - soldiers from an empire that had, not so long ago, provided for Darujhistan mothers chilling threats to belligerent children. <i>'Malazans, child! Skulking in the night to steal foolish children! To make you slaves for their terrible Empress - yes! Here in this very city!</i>' <p></p>But the torcs she had seen this night were not the plain bronze or faintly etched silver of genuine Malazan decorations and signi.ers of rank, such as appeared like relics from some long- dead cult in the city's market stalls. No, these had been gold, studded with gems, the blue of sapphire being the commonest hue even among the coloured glass, blue like the blue .re for which the city was famous, blue to proclaim some great and brave service to Darujhistan itself. <p></p>Her fingers had pressed upon one such torc, there on her husband's arm, although there was real muscle beneath it, a hardness to match the contemptuous look in his eyes as he surveyed the clusters of nobility in the vast humming hall, with the proprietary air he had acquired since attaining the Council. The contempt had been there long before and if anything had grown since his latest and most triumphant victory. <p></p>Daru gestures of congratulation and respect had swirled round them in their stately passage through the crowds, and with each acknowledgement her husband's face had grown yet harder, the arm beneath her fingers drawing ever tauter, the knuckles of his hands whitening above his sword- belt where the thumbs were tucked into braided loops in the latest fashion among duellists. Oh, he revelled in being among them now; indeed, in being above many of them. But for Gorlas Vidikas, this did not mean he had to like any of them. The more they fawned, the deeper his contempt, and that he would have been offended without their obsequy was a contradiction, she suspected, that a man like her husband was not wont to entertain. <p></p>The nobles had eaten and drunk, and stood and posed and wandered and paraded and danced themselves into swift exhaustion, and now the banquet halls and staterooms echoed with naught but the desultory ministrations of servants. Beyond the high walls of the estates, however, the common folk rollicked still in the streets. Masked and half naked, they danced on the cobbles - the riotous whirling steps of the Flaying of Fander - as if dawn would never come, as if the hazy moon itself would stand motionless in the abyss in astonished witness to their revelry. City Watch patrols simply stood back and observed, drawing dusty cloaks about their bodies, gauntlets rustling as they rested hands on truncheons and swords. <p></p>On the balcony where she stood, the fountain of the unlit garden directly below chirped and gurgled to itself, buffered by the estate's high, solid walls from the raucous festivities they had witnessed during the tortured carriage ride back home. Smeared moonlight struggled in the softly swirling pool surrounding the fountain. <p></p>The blue fire was too strong this night, too strong even for the mournful moon. Darujhistan itself was a sapphire, blazing in the torc of the world. And yet its beauty, and all its delighted pride and its multitudinous voice, could not reach her tonight. <p></p>This night, Lady Vidikas had seen her future. Each and every year of it. There on her husband's hard arm. And the moon, well, it looked like a thing of the past, a memory dimmed by time, yet it had taken her back. <p></p>To a balcony much like this one in a time that now seemed very long ago. <p></p>Lady Vidikas, who had once been Challice Estraysian, had just seen her future. And was discovering, here in this night and standing against this rail, that the past was a better place to be. <p></p>Talk about the worst night yet to run out of Rhivi flatbread. Swearing under her breath, Picker pushed her way through the crowds of the Lakefront market, the mobs of ferociously hungry, drunk revellers, using her elbows when she needed to and glowering at every delirious smile swung her way, and came out eventually at the mouth of a dingy alley heaped ankle- deep in rubbish. Somewhere just to the south of Borthen Park. Not quite the route back to the bar she would have preferred, but the fete was in full frenzy. Wrapped package of flatbread tucked under her left arm, she paused to tug loose the tangles of her heavy cloak, scowled on seeing a fresh stain from a careless passer- by - some grotesque Gadrobi sweetcake - tried wiping it off which only made it worse, then, her mood even fouler, set out through the detritus. <p></p>With the Lady's pull, Bluepearl and Antsy had fared better in finding Saltoan wine and were even now back at K'rul's. And here she was, twelve streets and two wall passages away with twenty or thirty thousand mad fools in between. Would her companions wait for her? Not a chance. Damn Blend and her addiction to Rhivi flatbread! That and her sprained ankle had conspired to force Picker out here on the first night of the fete - if that ankle truly <i>was</i> sprained, and she had her doubts since Mallet had just squinted down at the offending appendage, then shrugged. <p></p>Mind you, that was about as much as anyone had come to expect from Mallet. He'd been miserable since the retirement, and the chance of the sun's rising any time in the healer's future was about as likely as Hood's forgetting to tally the count. And it wasn't as if he was alone in his misery, was it? <p></p>But where was the value in feeding her ill temper with all these well- chewed thoughts? Well, it made her feel better, that's what. <p></p>Dester Thrin, wrapped tight in black cloak and hood, watched the big- arsed woman kicking her way through the rubbish at the other end of the alley. He'd picked her up coming out of the back door of K'rul's Bar, the culmination of four nights positioned in the carefully chosen, darkness- shrouded vantage point from which he could observe that narrow postern. <p></p>His clan- master had warned that the targets were all ex- soldiers, but Dester Thrin had seen little to suggest that any of them had kept .t and trim. They were old, sagging, rarely sober, and this one, well, she wore that huge, thick woollen cloak because she was getting heavy and it clearly made her self- conscious. <p></p>Following her through the crowds had been relatively easy - she was a head taller than the average Gadrobi, and the route she took to this decrepit Rhivi market in Lakefront seemed to deliberately avoid the Daru streets, some strange affectation that would, in a very short time, prove fatal. <p></p>Dester's own Daru blood had permitted him a clear view of his target, pushing purposefully through the heaving press of celebrants. <p></p>He set out to traverse the alley once his target exited at the far end. Swiftly padding at a hunter's pace, he reached the alley mouth and edged out, in time to see the woman move into the passageway through Second Tier Wall, with the tunnel through Third just beyond. <p></p>The Guild's succession wars, following the disappearance of Vorcan, had finally been settled, with only a minimum amount of spilled blood. And Dester was more or less pleased with the new Grand Master, who was both vicious and clever where most of the other aspirants had been simply vicious. At last, an assassin of the Guild did not have to be a fool to feel some optimism regarding the future. <p></p>This contract was a case in point. Straightforward, yet one sure to earn Dester and the others of his clan considerable prestige upon its summary completion. <p></p>He brushed his gloved hands across the pommels of his daggers, the weapons slung on baldrics beneath his arms. Ever reassuring, those twin blades of Daru steel with their ferules filled with the thick, pasty poison of Moranth tralb. <p></p>Poison was now the preferred insurance for a majority of the Guild's street killers, and indeed for more than a few who scuttled Thieves' Road across the rooftops. There'd been an assassin, close to Vorcan herself, who had, on a night of betrayal against his own clan, demonstrated the deadliness of fighting without magic.

The war in Europe is drawing to a close when the British government finally agrees to send a brigade of five thousand Jewish volunteers from Palestine to Europe to fight the German army. Among these soldiers are Israel Carmi, a veteran of the Haganah underground, a man who serves one army but whose loyalties belong to another; Johanan Peltz raised on, a vast, estate in Poland he dreams of returning home as a British officer and gentleman; and Arie Pinchuk, a former student who has returned to Europe with his own secret agenda -- to rescue his last remaining family member: the little sister he left behind. At the Senio River, Peitz leads the troops in a daring bayonet charge into the heart of the German line. When the savage hand-to-hand combat is finished, the men of the brigade emerge triumphant. At a time when Jews are being victimized, these soldiers -- yellow Stars of David emblazoned on their uniform sleeves -- show the world that a Jewish army can fight back. And win.</p><p>But when the war ends and the soldiers witness firsthand the horrors their people have suffered in the concentration camps, the men launch a brutal and calculating campaign of vengeance, forming secret squads to identify, locate, and kill Nazi officers in hiding. Their own ferocity threatens to overwhelm them until a fortuitous encounter with an orphaned girl sets the men on a course of action -- rescuing Jewish war orphans and transporting them to Palestine -- that will not only change their lives but also forever alter the course of world history. With The Brigade, bestselling author Howard Blum has written his most harrowing and important book to date -- a story that is certain to make headlines as well as provoke debate about the moral elements ofjustice, the dividing lines between good and evil, and the possibility of redemption.</p></p><p><p>Howard Blum is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and Edgar Award winner <em>American Lightning</em>, as well as <em>Wanted!</em>, <em>The Gold of Exodus</em>, <em>Gangland</em>, <em>The Floor of Heaven, </em>and, most recently,&nbsp;a&nbsp;2018 <em>New York Times </em>Notable Book<em>: In the Enemy's House</em>. Blum is a contributing editor at <em>Vanity Fair</em>. While at the <em>New York Times</em>, he was twice nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting. He is the father of three children, and lives in Connecticut. </p>Although the official history of the Jewish Brigade Group (a unit of some 5,000 Jews who fought with the British Eighth Army in Italy in the waning months of the conflict) has been written, Blum (Wanted! The Search for Nazis in America) breaks new ground by looking into the clandestine operations that occurred after the shooting had stopped. Once they learned the true extent of the holocaust, soldiers of the brigade began using intelligence reports to pinpoint the location of former SS officers and camp guards. The enraged Jewish troops took vengeance into their own hands, eventually slaying hundreds of Nazi death dealers. Blum follows the story of three men Israel Carmi, Johanan Peltz and Arie Pinchuk in detail, interviewed dozens of others, read unpublished personal memoirs and had Hebrew-language documents translated for him. During the war, the more daring Jewish soldiers formed a secret unit that appropriated British supplies trucks, weapons and food and diverted them to ships heading illegally for Palestine The plan included the "repatriation" of thousands of war orphans, who were clandestinely taken from displaced person camps and smuggled to Palestine. The underground Jewish Haganah figured prominently in these operations, which contributed directly to the creation of Israel. Blum, twice nominated for a Pulitzer as a New York Times investigative reporter, and now a Vanity Fair contributing editor, presents the material masterfully, building suspense and carefully documenting all the action. 16 pages of photos not seen by PW.

N. Wilson narrates with dazzling, witty, wonderfully readable prose the complex drama of the writer&#39;s life--his childhood of aristocratic privilege but emotional deprivation, his discovery of his literary genius after aimless years of gambling and womanizing, his increasingly disastrous marriage. Wilson sweeps away the long-held belief that Tolstoy&#39;s works were the exact mirror of his life, and instead traces the roots of Tolstoy&#39;s art to his relationship with God, with women, and with Russia. He also breaks new ground in re-creating the world that shaped the great novelist&#39;s life and art--the turmoil of ideas and politics in nineteenth-century Russia and the incredible literary renaissance that made Tolstoy&#39;s work possible. Most of all, Wilson fathoms, as no other biographer has done, the true nature of Tolstoy the man.</p><p>A. N. Wilson is the author of the acclaimed biographies Tolstoy, C. S.

When she's not writing, she's reading. Anne lives in Toronto, Ontario, where she works full-time as a teacher-librarian.</p>Grade 1-3-A Canadian boy plans to be a Mountie someday. When he has to find his younger brother before a fierce storm arrives, he has a glimpse of what this life might entail. On his trusty horse, he rides through the fields and valleys until he finds Will catching frogs in a muddy stream. Together they race the storm until they are safely back home. The future Mountie has performed his duty well and, as the day ends, he brushes Bess and checks on his soundly sleeping little brother one more time. Beautiful watercolor illustrations fill the pages as they capture the golden hues of the prairie and the ferocious darkness of the storm. They illuminate the action and provide insight into the lives of the characters in details such as the oil lamps, the water basin for washing, and the tin drinking cup. Some wildlife is also represented, including a prairie dog, a coyote, and a heron. The text has a poetic ring but may be a bit daunting to many young readers and listeners as they try to determine the meanings of stook, coulee, and slough.

Yes, the golden age of gardening is dawning, and much of the current enthusiasm for creating distinctive, unforgettable designs was spurred by nationally respected landscape architect and horticulturist Michael Weishan. His impeccable taste, common sense, and comprehensive knowledge of America's gardening history make him the ideal advisor for today's gardeners.<br><br>Respectful of the past and mindful of contemporary needs and lifestyles, Weishan lays down the underlying principles for creating--either from scratch or from the ghost of a lost garden--a domestic landscape with purpose and personality. He explains with utmost clarity how to <br><br>- Discover exactly which type and style of garden is right for you<br>- Analyze the archaeology of your old garden and recreate it from the past<br>- Arrange walls and fences for beauty and privacy<br>- Transform front, side, and back yards into one harmonious environment<br>- Lay out graceful walks and drives; rescue an orphaned front door<br>- Master the disciplined symmetry of a formal garden, the exuberance of a Victorian yard, or the charming randomness of a cottage garden<br>- Establish a mini-orchard featuring delicious rediscovered varieties of apples, peaches, cherries, and other fruits and berries<br><br>Lavishly designed with more than two hundred illustrations, The New Traditional Garden also includes a compendium of historic plants, detailed plans for great antique gardens, a directory of the most beautiful historic gardens in America, a comprehensive list of garden suppliers, and hundreds of other features to help you create a garden with elegance and character.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Author Michael Weishan is an expert in recreating gardens of early America; his mission is to resurrect the styles of the 18th and 19th century, when settlers in the New World were trying to distinguish their landscapes from the British style so beloved by gardeners today. This book is particularly targeted toward owners of Colonial- or Victorian-style homes, and the narration has a bit of a highbrow New England feel to it in lines like, "our founding fathers, men so dedicated to a controlled system of checks and balances that they fought and won a war to establish their principles, built gardens imbued with the same spirit." Weishan emphasizes "order and balance," and he wishes the '50s had never happened, with those boring perfect lawns and hardware-store perennials.<p> Throughout <i>The New Traditional Garden</i> there are evocative passages about locating the "ghosts" within the garden: covered-over plantings, perennials that have reappeared each spring for decades. "Be on the lookout for something old in the garden," Weishan writes. "You never know when it may teach you something new." For gardeners who find that working the soil is a nostalgic process that's as much about uncovering the past as creating a future, this is an expert guide. It includes an exhaustive historic plant list, dating the introduction of various species back to the 1700s. Weishan's ultimate goal is to remind us of early American attitudes of "stewardship," wherein we see ourselves as tenants of the land, caretakers, not tyrannical owners who must make our mark at any cost. <i>--Emily White</i></p>Michael Weishan is a nationally known horticulturist and garden designer who is featured every week on National Public Radio's "Living on Earth," a one-hour gardening program. Weishan owns and operates GardenWorks, Ltd., specializing in historically accurate landscapes. He has developed gardens for the 1720 Gold Ball Tavern in Weston, Massachusetts, early 19th-century whaling cottages in Mattapoisett and Nantucket, carpenter Gothic houses in the Midwest, high Victorian mansions in Cambridge and Boston, and neoclassical revivals in Concord, Massachusetts.

He defines disintegration as disharmony within the individual and in his adaptation to the external environment. Anxiety, psychoneurosis, and psychosis are symptoms of disintegration. In general, disintegration refers to involution, psychopathology, and retrogression to a lower level of psychic functioning. Integration is the opposite: evolution, psychic health, and adequate adaptation, both within the self and to the environment. Dabrowski postulates a developmental instinct&#x2014;that is, a tendency of man to evolve from lower to higher levels of personality. He regards personality as primarily developing through dissatisfaction with, and fragmentation of, the existing psychic structure&#x2014;a period of disintegration&#x2014;and finally a secondary integration at a higher level. Dabrowski feels that no growth takes place without previous disintegration. He regards symptoms of anxiety, psychoneurosis, and even some symptoms of psychosis as the signs of the disintegration stage of this evolution, and therefore not always pathological. <p> </p><p> Praise for <i>Positive Disintegration:</i> </p><p> POSITIVE DISINTEGRATION </p><p> </p><p> &#x201c;Dabrowski&#x2019;s theory is not only interesting but even exciting in its breadth and depth of its implications. The ubiquity of psychological symptoms has always confounded a simple descriptive psychopathological approach to mental illness. Dabrowski&#x2019;s theory gives these symptoms a role in normal personality development that is consistent with their broad distribution as shown by epidemiological studies and as felt by those aware of the problems in themselves and in those around them.&#x201d; <br>~ Jason Aronson, Harvard Medical School </p><p> Praise for other works by Dabrowski: </p><p> MENTAL GROWTH THROUGH POSITIVE DISINTEGRATION </p><p> </p><p> &#x201c;I consider this to be one of the most important contributions to psychological and psychiatric theory in this whole decade. There is little question in my mind that this book will be read for another decade or two, and very widely. It digs very deep and comes up with extremely important conclusions that will certainly change the course of psychological theorizing and the practice of psychotherapy for some time to come.&#x201d; <br>~ Abraham H. Maslow, Brandeis University </p><p> PERSONALITY-SHAPING THROUGH POSITIVE DISINTEGRATION </p><p> </p><p> &#x201c;Dr. Kazimierz Dabrowski is no ordinary psychiatrist. Although educated as a physician, he has developed a conception of man and his 'existential' vagaries which radically transcends the physical and biological realms; and although later trained in Freudian psychoanalysis, he has a point of view which, instead of denigrating morality and idealism, puts them in a place of supreme importance. <br><br> Dr. Dabrowski has certainly been a pioneer in the development of the kind of psychiatry that is set forth in this book, and he deserves great credit for his originality and courage. But, at the same time there is nothing singular or eccentric about his particular orientation. It is, in fact, part and parcel of a widespread and growing perspective in clinical psychology and psychiatry which can only be described as revolutionary.&#x201d; <br>~ O. Hobart Mowrer, University of Illinois </p><p></p></p><p>Kazimierz Dabrowski, M.D., Ph.D., (1902 - 1980) was born in Poland.

Dabrowski was a very prolific scholar; his publications number in the hundreds in Polish, including some twenty major books.

Marion Taylor presents a one-volume reference tool that introduces readers to a wide array of women interpreters of the Bible from the entire history of Christianity. Her research has implications for understanding biblical interpretation--especially the history of interpretation--and influencing contemporary study of women and the Bible. Contributions by 130 top scholars introduce foremothers of the faith who address issues of interpretation that continue to be relevant to faith communities today, such as women's roles in the church and synagogue and the idea of religious feminism. Women's interpretations also raise awareness about differences in the ways women and men may read the Scriptures in light of differences in their life experiences.<br><br>This handbook will prove useful to ministers as well as to students of the Bible, who will be inspired, provoked, and challenged by the women introduced here. The volume will also provide a foundation for further detailed research and analysis.<br><br>Interpreters include Elizabeth Rice Achtemeier, Saint Birgitta of Sweden, Catherine Mumford Booth, Anne Bradstreet, Catherine of Siena, Clare of Assisi, Egeria, Elizabeth I, Hildegard, Julian of Norwich, Th�r�se of Lisieux, Marcella, Henrietta C.

The array of interpreters covered here is breathtaking. Marion Ann Taylor has made a real contribution with this expertly edited volume, which recovers and analyzes women's voices. This splendid work deserves a primary place among biblical interpretation resources and much praise for its extensive and exciting discoveries."<br>--<b>Donald K. McKim</b>, editor, <i>Dictionary of Major Biblical Interpreters<br></i><br>"What a gift and an invitation this book is! For too long I have been frustrated at my own lack of knowledge about the history of women's interpretive engagement with the Bible. Marion Taylor's astonishing book changes everything. The judicious choice of women interpreters, the succinct but informative articles, and the immensely valuable bibliographies suddenly make it possible to teach and to write about women's interpretation of the Bible throughout history."<br>--<b>Carol A. Newsom</b>, Emory University<br><br>"Through pioneering and painstaking research, the <i>Handbook of Women Biblical Interpreters</i> brilliantly puts on display the insights and reflections of women on the most important book in the history of the world. I have been waiting eagerly for this handbook, and I will henceforth consult it frequently and with delight. All serious students of the Bible need to add it to their collection--especially those who don't think they need it."<br>--<b>Timothy Larsen</b>, Wheaton College"An elegantly written collection of entries examining women's influential reflections on Scripture and their own female identity. Each entry provides an enticing glimpse of a woman's engagement with the biblical text and frames her contribution in its historical setting. These readings of Scripture speak afresh into our own time, enriching and invigorating our understanding of the Bible."<br>--<b>Lynn H. Cohick</b>, Wheaton College<br><br>"This exhilarating volume can justly be described as one of the finest fruits yet to be harvested from the past half century of work on women's history and women's relationships to the interpretation of the Bible from the early church to the present. Taylor has included a judicious but generous selection of women biblical interpreters; individual contributors rank among the world's experts; and the articles themselves frequently treat readers to excerpts from these women's original writings. The stories encapsulated here are by turns surprising, fascinating, wry, poignant, and heartening."<br>--<b>John L. Thompson</b>, Fuller Theological Seminary; author, <i>Reading the Bible with the Dead<br></i><br>"A fascinating glimpse into the stories and writings of women across two thousand years of history. We are introduced to such diverse biblical interpreters as Elizabeth Achtemeier, Marie Guyart, Hildegard of Bingen, Julian of Norwich, Dorothy Sayers, Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Bringing together 180 female interpreters into a single volume provides a rare gift since women's voices have often been neglected in the history of interpretation. This handbook is a unique and valuable resource for any seeking to understand Scripture by listening to the historical community of faith."<br>--<b>Jeannine Brown</b>, Bethel Seminary<br><br>"What an extraordinary, fascinating, enthralling, moving, and mind-expanding volume! This guide has achieved a vital recovery of interpretive sources and makes it clear that these interpreters must be explored and seriously considered not only by those thirsting to find women's voices but also by anyone who desires to be comprehensively informed about the true scope and history of biblical interpretation."<br>--<b>John Goldingay</b>, Fuller Theological Seminary, and <b>Kathleen Goldingay<br></b><br>"To cover so many women, many of whom were silenced or forgotten, and to do so with evenness and compression is a remarkable achievement.

There's also a vital and continuing tradition of women's reform that sought social as well as individual rights and argued for the dismantling of the masculine standard. In this much anticipated book, Dorothy Sue Cobble retrieves the forgotten feminism of the previous generations of working women, illuminating the ideas that inspired them and the reforms they secured from employers and the state. This socially and ethnically diverse movement for change emerged first from union halls and factory floors and spread to the "pink collar" domain of telephone operators, secretaries, and airline hostesses. From the 1930s to the 1980s, these women pursued answers to problems that are increasingly pressing today: how to balance work and family and how to address the growing economic inequalities that confront us. <i>The Other Women's Movement</i> traces their impact from the 1940s into the feminist movement of the present.</p><br><p> The labor reformers whose stories are told in <i>The Other Women's Movement</i> wanted equality and "special benefits," and they did not see the two as incompatible. They argued that gender differences must be accommodated and that "equality" could not always be achieved by applying an identical standard of treatment to men and women. The reform agenda they championed--an end to unfair sex discrimination, just compensation for their waged labor, and the right to care for their families and communities--launched a revolution in employment practices that carries on today.</p><br><p> Unique in its range and perspective, this is the first book to link the continuous tradition of social feminism to the leadership of labor women within that movement.</p></p><p>Winner of the 28th Annual 2005 Philip Taft Labor History Award, International Association of Labour History Institutions Honorable Mention for the 2004 Gustavus Myers Outstanding Book Award, Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Bigotry and Human Rights One of Choice&#39;s Outstanding Academic Titles for 2004.<p>"The book is a tour de force of historical analysis. <i>The Other Women's Movement</i> pursues the very ambitious goal of reconstructing the historical relationship between feminism and working women in the United States between 1930 and 1980. The book brilliantly achieves this goal."<b>--Kathryn Kish Sklar, Binghamton University</b></p></p><h2>Born of Ice (A League Novel)</h2><p>In the Ichidian Universe where The League is law, most live in fear.

Drafted into the army in 1940, he served in the artillery at a flak base in Norway until the end of the war. After being held as a prisoner of war for eight months, he worked briefly as an interpreter for the British military police. His home in Lauban and, more importantly for him, his library had been lost in the war, and he and his wife were officially classified as Displaced Persons. In 1946 they found refuge in a one-room apartment in Cordingen in Lower Saxony. In 1958 Schmidt moved to the village of Bargfeld near Celle. Over the next 20 years, until his death in 1979, he wrote some of the landmarks of postwar German literature.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Best of Enemies (Sweet Valley High Sr. Year(TM))</h2><p><b>Jessica Wakefield</b> feel SORRY for <b>Melissa Fox</b>?<br><br>Not likely.<br><br>This is the girl who tried to ruin Jessica&#x2019;s life&#x2014;and it almost worked, too.

In <i>Swan</i>, her first novel, she has created an equally intimate world, rich with striking characters and intriguing twists of fate, that hearkens back to her southern roots.<br><br>The Masons are a prominent but now fragmented family who have lived for generations in Swan, an edenic, hidebound small town in Georgia. As <i>Swan </i>opens, a bizarre crime pulls Ginger Mason home from her life as an archeologist in Italy: The body of her mother, Catherine, a suicide nineteen years before, has been mysteriously exhumed. Reunited on new terms with her troubled, isolated brother J.J., who has never ventured far from Swan, the Mason children grapple with the profound effects of their mother's life and death on their own lives. When a new explanation for Catherine&#x2019;s death emerges, and other closely guarded family secrets rise to the surface as well, Ginger and J.J. are confronted with startling truths about their family, a particular ordeal in a family and a town that wants to keep the past buried.<br><br>Beautifully evoking the rhythms and idiosyncrasies of the deep South while telling an utterly compelling story of the complexity of family ties, <i>Swan</i> marks the remarkable fiction debut of one of America&#x2019;s best-loved writers.</p><p>It seems like there's a law that every novel set below the Mason-Dixon Line must feature a family secret, a beautiful dead mother, and a contested paternity. Also, iced tea. <i>Swan</i>, the debut novel from memoirist Frances Mayes (<i>Under the Tuscan Sun</i>, <i>Bella Tuscany</i>), is pretty standard stuff. J.J. Mason lives like a hermit in the woods outside the town of Swan, Georgia; his sister Ginger Mason works as an archaeologist in Italy. Their family has been in Swan forever; the whole town mourned when Caroline, Ginger, and J.J.'s mother committed suicide. Now the town joins in shock when Caroline's body is mysteriously and crudely exhumed. Ginger returns from Italy; J.J. comes into town. Over the course of a week in July 1975, and against a backdrop of townspeople, relatives, gossipy old biddies, and mill workers, the siblings explore the dark history of their mother's death. The book is competently done, and Mayes is clearly enjoying her break from the Tuscan sun--she especially seems to enjoy folksy-yet-Gothic Southernisms: "Who'd ever think someone that pretty could up and die? ... Just goes to show how quick it is from can to can't." Despite the book's grisly grave-digging, though, Mayes unearths nothing new. <i>--Claire Dederer</i>"This remains a solid read, sure to please readers who enjoy Southern fiction."<br><i>-Library Journal</i><br><br>"An assured fiction debut...Like Richard Russo's novel <i>Empire Falls</i>, it smartly dissects and dynamics of small-town relationships and the interplay between prominent families and the less powerful over several generations...carefully constructed...you'll fall for "Swan."<br><i>-USA Today </i><br><br>"Fueled by irresistable, page-turning questions."<br>-<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>"A painstaking study of a small Southern town and its people...combining [Mayes's] talent for vivid scene-setting that [she] showed in "Tuscan Sun" with deft plotting and solid character development."<br><i>-St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i><br><br>"Loaded with finely-drawn minor characters and the alluring atmosphere of the American South, <i>Swan</i> is a well-paced...entertainment."<br><i>-New York Times Book Review</i></p><h2>Beyond Death&#39;s Door</h2><p>All through recorded history people have&nbsp;&nbsp;predicted life after death.

This tribal connection has been largely lost in modern society, but regaining it may be the key to our psychological survival.</b><br><br> Decades before the American Revolution, Benjamin Franklin lamented that English settlers were constantly fleeing over to the Indians-but Indians almost never did the same. Tribal society has been exerting an almost gravitational pull on Westerners for hundreds of years, and the reason lies deep in our evolutionary past as a communal species. The most recent example of that attraction is combat veterans who come home to find themselves missing the incredibly intimate bonds of platoon life. The loss of closeness that comes at the end of deployment may explain the high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder suffered by military veterans today.<br><br> Combining history, psychology, and anthropology, TRIBE explores what we can learn from tribal societies about loyalty, belonging, and the eternal human quest for meaning. It explains the irony that-for many veterans as well as civilians-war feels better than peace, adversity can turn out to be a blessing, and disasters are sometimes remembered more fondly than weddings or tropical vacations. TRIBE explains why we are stronger when we come together, and how that can be achieved even in today's divided world.<br><br></p><p>Sebastian Junger is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Tribe</i>, <i>War</i>, <i>The Perfect Storm</i>, <i>Fire, </i>and <i>A Death in Belmont</i>.

From the narrative of Trostsky&#x2019;s uncompromising opposition to Stalin&#x2019;s policies emerge character studies of the important Soviet leaders; a brilliant portrait of Trotsky the man of ideas, the Marxist philosopher and literary critic; and a new assessment of the causes of defeat which led to his expulsion from the party, his exile, and his banishment from Russia.</p><p><b>Isaac Deutscher</b> was born in 1907 near Krakow and joined the Polish Communist Party, from which he was expelled in 1932. He then moved to London where he died in 1967. His other books include <i>Stalin</i> and <i>The Unfinished Revolution</i>.&#x201c;In the 1930s, Trotsky, with a handful of followers, attempted to block the path of Stalin&#x2019;s relentless hurricane of betrayal and murder.

Burley lived near Newquay in Cornwall, and was a schoolmaster until he retired to concentrate on his writing. His many Wycliffe novels were extremely popular and were adapted for a highly successful TV series starring Jack Shepherd. W.J. Burley died in 2002.Whenever a character comes back as many times as Chief Superintendent Wycliffe (21 appearances), a reviewer is faced with a dilemma: What can you say that you haven't already said? Reviewing <i>Wycliffe and the House of Fear</i> (1996), we called attention to Burley's "solid plotting, well-described and colorful setting, and intriguing characters." All that is equally true in this story of the disappearance and possible murder of redhead Morwenna Barker, last known to be working for a Falmouth bookseller whose testimony once sent her father to jail for manslaughter. Morwenna is much more than she seems in Burley's delightful teaser of a plot, and the Cornwall setting, with its remote valleys and rugged coasts, is as vividly described as ever. The characters, again led by the thoughtful and insightful Wycliffe, are thoroughly satisfying. Finally, we have no choice but to repeat ourselves by emphasizing one more time how pleasurable the familiar conventions of the genre can be in the hands of a writer as good as Burley. <i>Stuart Miller</i></p><h2>The Mystical Life of Jesus</h2><p>This is a fascinating, non-sectarian treatment of the unknown life of Jesus based on records preserved in the archives of ancient monasteries of the Essenes and the Rosicrucian Order.</p><p>Dr. H.

"You thinking of going back?"<br><br>"Oh, I don't know," I said, glancing around my living room, "not really." But my older brother knew me too well to believe that. "I guess so."<br><br>As journalists who always seemed to cover dangerous places, Jon and I had both had some close calls over the years, but a high percentage of mine had come during a single three-week period in Chechnya in 1995, and I'd returned from there quite rattled. Now, in February 2000, the Russians and Chechens were at war again, it was at least as vicious as before, and for reasons that weren't clear even to me, I wanted to return.<br><br>"You think it's a bad idea?" I asked.<br><br>Jon pondered this. "Remember Sarajevo?" He saw the puzzled look on my face. "The land mine?"<br><br>I laughed. In the summer of 1996, I'd done an astonishingly stupid thing in Bosnia. The war had ended six months earlier, but there were still mines everywhere, and one day I'd gone hiking in the hills above Sarajevo. Walking down a dirt trail I didn't know, I'd nearly stepped on a partially exposed mine in the path. On trembling legs, I'd spent the next two hours gingerly making my way back up the trail. I'd told Jon about it as a kind of humorous, embarrassing anecdote.<br><br>"But that was just idiotic," I said. "I got careless."<br><br>"Yeah, but you almost got yourself killed in peacetime. Don't you think that's kind of an omen?"<br><br>By the time of that conversation in my living room, Jon and I had spent most of our adult lives writing about the worst people and places in the world. That month, I had recently returned from northern Albania, where I'd reported a story on blood vendettas, while Jon was about to head off for war-ruined Angola. When we got together&#x2013;which, given our schedules, was only about every six months&#x2013;we talked of where we had just been, where we were thinking of going next.<br><br>What we did not talk about&#x2013;at least not directly&#x2013;was how any of this affected us. Instead, we had developed a kind of verbal shorthand with each other, the sharing of anecdotes, like mine about the ill-advised hike in Bosnia, that had no real punch lines: "And then I walked back to the hotel," or, "For a while it looked like they were going to shoot us, but then they waved us on and we drove to the capital." We didn't need punch lines; we'd both had enough of these moments to know what the other had felt.<br><br>Yet the sharing of these oblique stories served a purpose. My brother and I had both become increasingly superstitious over the years, convinced that all the narrow escapes in our past made it less likely that we would escape in the future, and we relied on each other to tote up the odds. "Is this bet too risky?" "Do I walk away from this story now?" And the reason we sought this guidance from one another was because, in a peculiar way, our stakes were joined, rooted in a secret fear that had held us all our adult lives: that something would happen to the other when he was off in the world and alone, that one of us would die on the other's watch.<br><br>The seed of this, I believe, had been planted twenty-five years earlier, in the first great journey my brother and I shared. Whether coincidence or not, that journey also marked the first time we began to regard each other with anything more than contempt.<br><br>Summer afternoons are always brutally hot in Gainesville, Florida, but this one, in the middle of June 1975, had been downright perverse. I'd come home from soccer practice wanting nothing more than to lie in front of the air conditioner, only to find my parents huddled close together at the dining-room table. I was surprised to see my father there&#x2014;my parents had recently divorced, and he came around less and less often&#x2014;but then I noticed that they were poring over a postcard.<br><br>"It's from your brother," my mother said, handing me the card. "He's had a bad accident."<br><br>The photo showed some mangy-looking beach in Honduras. On the back, Jon had crammed about eight hundred tiny words&#x2014;economical, perhaps, but mostly incomprehensible. Something about building a rock wall, collecting coconuts, meeting a witch doctor. The salient details were in the postscript: "P.S. Writing this from hospital. Accidentally kicked a machete and sliced open right foot. Swollen up to three times normal. Doctors say infected, maybe gangrenous, might have to amputate. Ah well, c'est la vie. Much love, Jon."<br><br>"Gee, that's a damned shame," I said, and faked a somber look for several seconds. "Well, gotta go take a shower."<br><br>While it was something our parents had refused to acknowledge, Jon and I were not close. If I really tried, I could dimly recall some pleasant moments in our early childhood, but not many. Much stronger was the memory of the day Jon decided to teach me how to catch by heaving a large rock at my head, leaving a jagged scar through my upper lip. I was six then, Jon eight, and it was a harbinger of the violence to come; from then on he beat me up almost daily. By the summer of 1975, though, I'd barely seen Jon for two years and was quite happy to keep it that way&#x2014;and if he lost a foot, well, it might just even the playing field in our next fistfight.<br><br>But I also saw precisely where this little gathering in the dining room was headed, for on the table next to my father was a small pile of papers: plane tickets, a thin vinyl folder of traveler's checks, and, on top, a half sheet of thin paper that I recognized as a telex record. Somebody was being press-ganged into rescuing Jon in Honduras, and from the way my parents stared at me, I had a pretty good idea who.<br><br>This might require a bit of explaining about my family. My brother, my three sisters, and I had spent most of our childhoods being bounced from one Third World country to the next, the result of our father being a foreign-aid officer for the American government. That upbringing, combined with our parents' hands-off approach to child rearing, had instilled in most of us a fiercely self-sufficient and adventurous streak. Jon, for example, had hitchhiked across East Africa by himself at thirteen. Our oldest sister, Michelle, had solo-trekked the Kalahari Desert on horseback at seventeen. At fourteen, I had spent two months on my own in Bangkok.<br><br>The catch to all this freedom, though, came into play whenever something went awry with one of us kids. Rather than directly involving themselves in the problem, our parents felt far more comfortable casting another of their children into the fray, and it was with Jon that problems most consistently arose. The previous year, he had dropped out of high school and, after announcing that he was off to the Spanish Sahara to join the Polisario guerrillas in their independence war against Morocco, promptly vanished somewhere between England and North Africa. Our parents had dispatched Michelle, then twenty, to search for him, and she'd eventually found him in the Canary Islands, living on the beach as he tried to repair an old boat he was planning to sail to the war zone. She'd hauled him back to the States, but it hadn't been long before Jon had set out once more, this time to Honduras to help build a friend's house on the Caribbean coast. That's where he had been for the past six months, and now he was in trouble again.<br><br>"You're sending Michelle, right?" I asked hopefully, reaching for the telex slip. My parents shook their heads.<br><br>My father loved sending telexes. They were charged by the word, with a maximum of ten characters per word, and he could spend hours devising messages that gave him his money's worth. This one was addressed to the main post office in La Ceiba, the town in Honduras where Jon got his mail, and he'd obviously put a lot of effort into it: scottcomes tohonduras tomorrowpm. norepeatno amputation beforethen lovemompop.<br><br>This was aggravating. My sophomore year in high school had ended a week earlier, and I had big plans for my summer vacation. It was more than that, though. I had always been the good son, the dutiful one, while Jon had always been the hellion, the one who'd started having run-ins with the law at age eleven. It was he who had introduced me to the fine art of shoplifting at eight, and, as he constantly reminded me, we never would have been caught if I hadn't started stealing expensive cigars to give to our father to assuage my guilt.<br><br>"Look," I said to my parents in the dining room, "Jon has been nothing but trouble to you people for years; did you stop to think that losing a foot might be just the thing to straighten him out?"<br><br>I think that for the briefest of moments my parents actually considered the idea. Then my father shook his head. "Let's not make a big deal out of this. All you have to do is go down there, get him out of the hospital, and put him on a plane home. You'll be back before you know it."<br><br>The Paris bar was one of the only places in La Ceiba with air-conditioning, and it felt pleasingly arctic compared to outside. Jon and I sat at a window table, sipping from beers and staring out at the plaza. I was not in a good mood. An hour earlier, I'd been sitting on the front steps of the tiny airport terminal in La Ceiba, contemplating how to find the hospital, when a small blue pickup truck raced up the driveway and came to a skidding, sideways stop. From out of the passenger seat leapt my brother. He was wearing a straw hat and had a sheathed machete dangling from one hip, and as he nimbly loped up the steps toward me, I couldn't help but notice that he still had both his feet. As it turned out, Jon had sent his fateful postcard nearly a month earlier, and, with the aid of penicillin injections, his foot was now fine.<br><br>"So why the hell didn't you call to say you were okay?" I asked.<br><br>"Well, I thought about it, but..." Jon shrugged lamely. After about a three-second pose of remorse, he grinned and gave a dismissive little backward flip of his hand-a new gesture. "Ah well," he said, "c'est la vie. Now that you're here, we'll just make the best of it. Come on, let's go into town."<br><br>I didn't have a lot of choice in the matter; the plane that had brought me had just taken off for the return to Miami, and there wouldn't be another one for two days. Angrily grabbing my rucksack, I followed Jon down to the pickup and climbed in for the ride to La Ceiba and the Paris bar.<br><br>Our conversation so far had been desultory, with lots of long silences and me staring fixedly out the window. Despite my bad mood, I was struck by how much my brother's appearance had changed in the six months since I'd last seen him: He was deeply tanned and muscular beneath his white T-shirt, and his blond hair had turned even blonder in the tropics. With his machete and his battered straw hat tilted to a rakish angle, he seemed like some Hollywood prototype of a jungle explorer. I fell to studying the machete, hanging from his belt to brush the floor.<br><br>"So, what's with the knife?" I asked.<br><br>He drew the machete, handed it to me by the black plastic handle. "Whacking things. Down here, you've always got to whack something."<br><br>It felt good, heavy, in the hand. The blade was nearly three feet long and razor sharp. I tried a couple of short wrist-flick swings in the air before giving it back.<br><br>"You know," Jon said, sliding the machete into its sheath, "now that you're here, you should stay awhile. My job just ended, and we can knock around, have some fun."<br><br>Beyond the dirty plate-glass window was La Ceiba's main square, a bedraggled little plaza with some rusting statue in the middle. I hadn't seen anything in Honduras so far that resembled fun. "Maybe you've forgotten," I said, "but we don't really like each other."<br><br>He seemed surprised by this. "I always thought we got along pretty well. Oh, sure, we had our little spats every once in a while, but all brothers go through that. It's not like I gave you any permanent scars or anything."<br><br>I leaned over the table, pointed to the thin scar in my lip where Jon had hit me with the rock ten years before. Throughout growing up, I'd been rather self-conscious about the scar, a self-consciousness Jon had done his best to promote by constantly referring to it as "the harelip." He squinted to see where I was pointing. "Oh, Christ," he said, "are you still on about the harelip? I apologized for that years ago." He sat back in disgust, motioned to the waitress for two more beers. I returned to staring out the window.<br><br>"So how are things in Florida?" Jon asked after a while.<br><br>A hard question to answer. Our family had disintegrated exactly two years earlier. My father had taken me out of school, and we'd spent a year traveling together across Europe and the Middle East, but then he'd left me in Florida with my mother and taken to the road again. I'd spent the next six months there plotting my escape: hitchhiking to wherever my father might be, heading to the Yukon to pan for gold with a Scottish guy I'd met on a ship crossing the Atlantic. It had only been very recently that I'd tried to adjust and settle into a normal high school existence. At the Paris bar, I told Jon only about that part&#x2014;about my friends, soccer, girls I was interested in&#x2014;but I could tell he wasn't buying it.<br><br>"It's not going to work, you know. Fitting in, becoming an American&#x2014;it's not going to work. We started too late to belong anywhere. The only thing we'll ever belong to is this family, each other."<br><br>He looked out the window, his eyes darting over the plaza. It was late afternoon, and the streets of La Ceiba were gradually coming back to life, couples strolling through the plaza, lottery-ticket sellers calling for customers in strange, bullfrog voices.<br><br>"And we're always going to end up in places like this."</p><h2>German Romantic Criticism: Novalis, Schlegel, Schleiermacher, and others (German Library)</h2><p>Includes: Schleiermacher&#39;s &#34;On the Different Methods of Translation;&#34; Jean Paul&#39;s &#34;School for Aesthetics;&#34; Novalis&#39;s &#34;Aphorisms and Fragments;&#34; Schlegel&#39;s &#34;Dialogue on Poetry and Lectures on Dramatic Art and Literature;&#34; Holderlin&#39;s &#34;On the Process of the Poetic Mind;&#34; von Kleist&#39;s &#34;On the Marionette Theater;&#34; Muller&#39;s &#34;Twelve Lectures on Rhetoric;&#34; von Humboldt&#39;s &#34;On the Imagination;&#34; Gorres&#39;s &#34;The German Chapbooks;&#34; and Grimm&#39;s &#34;On The Origin of Language.&#34;</p><p><br>Text: English, German (translation)</p>
